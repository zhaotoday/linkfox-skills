# Amazon Opportunity Screener by Metrics

This skill guides you on how to reverse-search Amazon niches and keywords from a metrics pool aggregated from historical opportunity reports, helping sellers turn vague selection ideas (low competition, growing demand, blue ocean, pain-point opportunity, etc.) into concrete niche candidates.

## Core Concepts

This tool exposes a queryable pool of **niche-level metrics** (~37 fields per record) distilled from past Amazon opportunity reports. Instead of generating a fresh report (forward analysis), it lets you **reverse-filter** the existing pool by 30+ business dimensions and returns matching `(marketplace, keyword)` records ranked by collection time (most recent first).

Records are at the **niche / keyword** level, not ASIN level. Each record represents a niche snapshot — its market size, growth, competition, price tiers, demographics, top features, and review themes.

**Forward vs. reverse**: Use `linkfox-amazon-opportunity-report` when the user has a keyword and wants a comprehensive AI report. Use this skill when the user has business criteria (filters) and wants to discover which keywords / niches fit.

## Filter Dimensions

Filters are grouped into six business dimensions. All filter parameters are optional, but **at least one of `keyword` / `nicheName` or any metric filter must be provided** — fully empty calls are rejected.

| Dimension | Example Parameters | Typical User Intent |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Market size & growth | `nicheRevenue360dMinUsdAtLeastGte`, `nichePeakSearchVolumeAtLeastGte`, `nicheSearchVolumeYoyChangePctAtLeastGte`, `nichePeakMonthGte/Lte` | "Big enough market", "fast-growing", "Q4 seasonal" |
| Competition density | `nicheBrandCountLte`, `nicheBrandCountYoyChangePctAtLeastLte`, `nicheTop5ProductClickSharePctAtLeastLte`, `featureTop5BrandSharePctAtLeastLte` | "Newcomer-friendly", "brands fragmented", "no oligopoly", "brands exiting" |
| Price & tier | `priceMinUsdGte`, `priceMaxUsdLte`, `priceSweetSpotMinUsdGte/Lte`, `priceEntryClickSharePctAtLeastGte`, `priceMidClickSharePctAtLeastLte`, `priceHighClickSharePctAtLeastGte` | "Affordable focus", "premium-friendly", "mid-tier blue ocean" |
| Demographics | `demoPrimaryAgeMinGte`, `demoPrimaryAgeMaxLte`, `demoGenderDominant`, `demoPrimaryIncomeTier`, `demoLifeStageTagsContains` | "Female-driven", "high-income", "parents", "fitness enthusiasts" |
| Product features | `featureNewAvgReviewCountAtLeastLte`, `featureEstablishedAvgReviewCountAtLeastLte`, `featureEmergingTrendTagsContains`, `featureUncommonFeatureTagsContains`, `searchTopCategory1Label` | "New-product entry barrier low", "emerging trend", "uncommon feature edge", "set/kit niches" |
| Review insights | `reviewPositiveTop1Topic`, `reviewPositiveTop1PctAtLeastGte/Lte`, `reviewNegativeTop1Topic`, `reviewNegativeTop1PctAtLeastGte/Lte`, `reviewNegativeTop2Topic`, `reviewStrategicInsightTagsContains` | "Pain-point niche", "comfort-driven sellers", "size-issue opportunity" |

See `references/api.md` for the full parameter list, types, value ranges, and response field map.

## Supported Marketplaces

Currently only **US** (United States) is supported. Always set `amazonDomain` to `US` (or omit). If a user requests other marketplaces, inform them this tool currently only covers the US market.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/amazon_opportunity_screener.py` directly to run queries.

## How to Build Queries

The user expresses business intent in natural language; you map it to **the smallest viable set of filters**. Principles:

1. **Convert intent into specific bounds**: "low competition" → `nicheBrandCountLte: 20`; "fast-growing" → `nicheSearchVolumeYoyChangePctAtLeastGte: 100` (≥100% YoY); "newcomer-friendly" → `featureNewAvgReviewCountAtLeastLte: 500`.
2. **Start narrow, then loosen**: First call usually with 2–4 strong filters and `limit=25`. If the result set is empty or too small, drop or widen the most aggressive filter rather than adding new ones.
3. **Pair complementary signals**: Brand-level + product-level concentration (`featureTop5BrandSharePctAtLeastLte` + `nicheTop5ProductClickSharePctAtLeastGte`) reveals "brands fragmented but products concentrated" — a brand-extension entry signal.
4. **Snake_case fragments for tag fields**: `featureEmergingTrendTagsContains`, `demoLifeStageTagsContains`, `reviewNegativeTop1Topic`, etc. accept snake_case word fragments and use LIKE matching. Pass a root word (`size`, `parent`, `cordless`) to cover normalized variants.
5. **Faithful to user intent**: Don't silently add filters the user didn't ask for. If they only said "growing", just filter on growth — don't also constrain price unless they mentioned it.

### Common Scenarios

**1. Niche reverse-lookup by keyword**
```json
{"keyword": "whoop band", "limit": 25}
```

**2. Newcomer-friendly low-competition niches**
```json
{"nicheBrandCountLte": 20, "featureNewAvgReviewCountAtLeastLte": 500, "limit": 25}
```

**3. High-growth blue ocean (≥100% YoY, brands not yet flooding in)**
```json
{"nicheSearchVolumeYoyChangePctAtLeastGte": 100, "nicheBrandCountYoyChangePctAtLeastLte": 30, "limit": 25}
```

**4. Mid-tier price gap (low-price dominates, mid-tier scarce)**
```json
{"priceEntryClickSharePctAtLeastGte": 70, "priceMidClickSharePctAtLeastLte": 5, "limit": 25}
```

**5. Pain-point entry — strong size complaints**
```json
{"reviewNegativeTop1Topic": "size", "reviewNegativeTop1PctAtLeastGte": 70, "limit": 25}
```

**6. Premium-friendly female-driven niches**
```json
{"demoGenderDominant": "female", "demoPrimaryIncomeTier": "high", "priceHighClickSharePctAtLeastGte": 25, "limit": 25}
```

**7. Q4 seasonal niches with ≥100k peak search**
```json
{"nichePeakMonthGte": 11, "nichePeakMonthLte": 12, "nichePeakSearchVolumeAtLeastGte": 100000, "limit": 25}
```

**8. Track niches around a known competitor brand**
```json
{"featureTopBrandsContains": "WHOOP", "limit": 50}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data only**: Render the returned niches as a clean comparison table — niche name / keyword, market size, growth, brand count, price range, key tags. No subjective business advice.
2. **Surface the active filters**: Echo the filter set you used so the user can adjust ("当前筛选：品牌数 ≤ 20 且搜索量同比 ≥ 100%").
3. **Time-snapshot reminder**: Records reflect data at collection time and are not continuously updated. Mention this when results look stale or contradict a user's external knowledge.
4. **Empty / few-result handling**: If `data` is empty or very short, suggest widening the most aggressive filter rather than re-asking the user from scratch.
5. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the `msg` field (most often the "fully empty parameters" guard) and suggest adding at least one filter.
6. **No secondary aggregation**: The results power frontend rendering and are not stored, so they cannot be fed into `@智能数据查询` (intelligent data query) for further aggregation. If users ask for grouped statistics across niches, do the calculation locally or pull a wider `limit` first.

## Important Limitations

- **US only**: Currently only supports the United States marketplace (`amazonDomain` = `US`).
- **No pagination**: There is no `page` parameter. Increase `limit` (max 200) to widen the candidate pool; results are sorted by collection time (newest first).
- **At least one filter required**: Calls with no `keyword` / `nicheName` and no metric filter are rejected.
- **Snapshot data**: Records are aggregated from historical opportunity reports; new reports refresh the pool over time, but individual records are not real-time.
- **Niche-level granularity**: The output is niche / keyword level, not ASIN level. To dig into specific products inside a niche, hand off to `linkfox-amazon-search`, `linkfox-keepa-product-search`, etc.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** — Niche-level reverse selection on the US Amazon market:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Low-competition niches", "newcomer-friendly", "brand-light" | Brand-density filter |
| "Brands are exiting", "old players retreating" | Negative brand-count YoY |
| "Fast-growing niche", "trending up", "≥100% YoY" | Search-volume YoY filter |
| "Mid-tier blue ocean", "low-price dominates but mid is scarce" | Price-tier share gap |
| "Premium-friendly", "high-income consumers" | Income tier + high-tier share |
| "Female / male / mixed market" | Gender dominance filter |
| "Parents / students / retirees / fitness enthusiasts" | Life-stage tag |
| "Strong size / quality / durability pain point" | Negative review topic + share |
| "Comfort-driven", "value-driven sellers" | Positive review topic + share |
| "Track all niches around brand X" | `featureTopBrandsContains` |
| "Q4 seasonal niches", "Prime Day window" | Peak month + peak volume |

**Not applicable** — Use other tools instead:
- Need a comprehensive AI report on one keyword → `linkfox-amazon-opportunity-report`
- ASIN-level competitor research, sales estimation → SellerSprite / Keepa / Sorftime tools
- Real-time keyword ranking, search-term mining → ABA / SIF tools
- Marketplaces other than US → not yet supported by this tool
- Want to run group-by aggregation over niches via `@智能数据查询` → unsupported (data is not warehoused)

**Boundary judgment**: When users describe selection criteria in business language and want matching candidate niches, this skill applies. When they hand you a specific keyword and want the full multi-dimensional analysis, use `linkfox-amazon-opportunity-report`. When they want to drill into ASINs / sellers within a niche, hand off to product-search tools.
