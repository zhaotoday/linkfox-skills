# Amazon Product Detail Lookup

This skill guides you on how to retrieve and analyze detailed Amazon product information by ASIN, helping Amazon sellers and researchers extract comprehensive listing data from product pages across 22 Amazon marketplaces.

## Core Concepts

This tool performs front-end simulation of Amazon product pages to extract structured detail data. It returns rich information including the product title, main image, additional images, bullet points (About This Item), product specifications, A+ content description, pricing, ratings distribution, variant structure, and optionally "Frequently Bought Together" and "Related Products" data.

**Billing note**: This tool is billed per ASIN queried. Because the cost is higher than search-based tools, guide users to query only the ASINs they truly need rather than large exploratory batches.

**Batch support**: Up to 40 ASINs can be queried in a single request, provided as a comma-separated string.

## Parameter Guide

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/amazon_product_detail.py` directly to run queries.

```
Get product details for B072MQ5BRX and B08N5WRWNW.
```

**3. Lookup on a non-US marketplace**
```

```
Parameters: `{"asins": "B072MQ5BRX", "amazonDomain": "amazon.co.uk", "device": "mobile"}`

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show product details in a well-structured format -- use tables for specifications and pricing comparisons, bullet lists for "About This Item" content
2. **Image handling**: When the response includes image URLs (`productImageUrls`, `thumbnail`, `imageUrl`), present them as clickable links or embedded images as appropriate
3. **Multi-ASIN results**: When multiple ASINs are queried, organize results so each product is clearly separated and labeled by ASIN and title
4. **Price formatting**: Always include the currency symbol/code alongside price values. Show both current price and original price (if discounted) to highlight deals
5. **Rating breakdown**: When `customerReviews` data is present, show the star distribution (5-star through 1-star percentages) alongside the overall rating and total review count
6. **Variant display**: When variants exist, present them in a compact table grouped by variant dimension (color, size, etc.)
7. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason and suggest checking that the ASIN is valid and the marketplace domain is correct
8. **Cost awareness**: Remind users that this tool charges per ASIN, so they should batch only what they need
## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Tasks that require structured Amazon product page data:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Look up this ASIN", "Get product details for ..." | Single/batch ASIN detail lookup |
| "What are the bullet points for this product" | Listing content extraction |
| "Show me competitor listings" | Multi-ASIN comparison |
| "What's the price of this ASIN on Amazon DE" | Cross-marketplace price check |
| "How many reviews does this product have" | Rating & review analysis |
| "What variants does this product offer" | Variant structure inspection |
| "Get the A+ content / product description" | Product description retrieval |
| "What's the main image for this ASIN" | Product image extraction |
| "Is this product Prime eligible" | Eligibility / badge check |
| "What are the product specs / dimensions" | Specification lookup |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond product detail page data:

- Keyword / search term analysis (use ABA Data Explorer instead)
- Search result rankings or organic position tracking
- Advertising / PPC campaign data
- Sales estimation or revenue calculations
- Inventory management or FBA fee analysis
- Review sentiment analysis requiring NLP beyond raw review text
- Historical price tracking over time (this tool returns current snapshot only)

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "analyze this product" or "research this ASIN", if it boils down to retrieving the current product page data (title, price, bullets, images, reviews, variants), this skill applies. If they need historical trends, sales estimates, or advertising insights, it does not apply.


**Feedback:**

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
4. Anything you believe could be improved

Call the feedback API as specified in `references/api.md`. Do not interrupt the user's flow.
