# 1688 Product Search (DianLeiDa)

This skill guides you on how to search and analyze products on the 1688 wholesale platform, helping e-commerce sellers and sourcing professionals find quality suppliers and profitable products.

## Core Concepts

This tool provides keyword-based product search on 1688 (China's largest B2B wholesale marketplace). It aggregates product listings with sales data, pricing tiers, supplier credentials, and fulfillment options. Data is sourced from DianLeiDa (store radar analytics) and covers real-time product listings with 7-day and 30-day sales metrics.

**Key terminology**:
- **Wholesale price** (`price`): The price per unit when ordering at the minimum batch quantity
- **Dropship price** (`consignPrice`): The price per unit for single-item dropshipping (typically higher than wholesale)
- **TrustPass years** (`tpYear`): The number of years the supplier has held Alibaba's TrustPass membership, indicating business longevity
- **Sales count** (`salesQuantity`): Total units sold in the selected time period
- **Order count** (`salesOrderCount`): Total number of separate orders in the selected time period
- **Estimated sales volume** (`estimatedSalesAmount`): Estimated revenue in the selected time period

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show results in structured tables with product title, price, sales metrics, and supplier info. Include product URLs so users can visit listings directly.
2. **Price context**: Always show both wholesale price and dropship price when available, so users can compare margins.
3. **Sales metrics**: Clearly label whether metrics are 7-day or 30-day figures based on the `cycle` parameter used.
4. **Image display**: When `imageUrl` is available, display product images to help users visually identify products.
5. **Pagination notice**: When `total` exceeds the returned page size, inform users of the total result count and that they can request additional pages.
6. **Error handling**: If a query returns an error, explain the issue and suggest adjusting parameters (e.g., broadening filters, checking keyword spelling).
7. **Keyword translation**: If the user provides English product terms, translate to Chinese before calling the API, and note this translation in your response.
## Applicable Scenarios

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Find suppliers for XX on 1688" | Keyword product search |
| "What's selling well on 1688" | Top-selling product discovery |
| "Find cheap XX from factories" | Factory sourcing with price filters |
| "1688 dropshipping suppliers for XX" | Dropship-enabled product search |
| "Compare prices for XX on 1688" | Price comparison across suppliers |
| "New products on 1688 for XX" | New product discovery |

| "Which 1688 suppliers ship within 24h" | Fulfillment speed filtering |
| "Top factories for XX" | Super Factory / Power Merchant search |
| "Find this 1688 product" (with URL or ID) | Direct product lookup |

## Not Applicable

- Amazon or other non-1688 platform product research
- 1688 store/shop-level analytics (store traffic, store rankings)
- 1688 advertising or promotion strategies
- Product review or rating analysis
- Logistics cost calculation or freight estimation
- Order placement or transaction processing
- User already has local product data files to analyze

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "sourcing", "find suppliers", or "wholesale products", if it involves searching for specific products on the 1688 platform with filters like price, sales, or supplier type, this skill applies. If they need store-level analytics, advertising optimization, or operations beyond product search, it does not apply.
