# eBay Product Search

This skill guides you on how to search and retrieve eBay product listing data, helping e-commerce sellers and buyers find products, compare prices, and analyze market trends across eBay's global marketplaces.

## Core Concepts

eBay Product Search provides access to eBay's front-end product listing data. It supports keyword-based search with rich filtering options including price range, item condition, buying format, sort order, seller location, and more. Results include product details such as title, price, shipping info, seller rating, sold quantity, and item condition.

**Marketplace logic**: The `ebayDomain` parameter controls which regional eBay site is searched. The default is `ebay.com` (US). When a user refers to a country or region, map it to the corresponding eBay domain (e.g., UK -> `ebay.co.uk`, Germany -> `ebay.de`).

**Buying format**: eBay supports multiple buying formats -- `Auction` for bid-based listings, `BIN` (Buy It Now) for fixed-price listings, and `BO` (Best Offer) for negotiable listings.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show search results in well-formatted tables including key fields such as title, price, condition, seller info, and shipping
2. **Price formatting**: Always display prices with their currency symbol. When showing price ranges (minPrice to maxPrice), format as a range
3. **Sold/completed data**: When showing sold items, highlight the sold price and quantity to help users with pricing research
4. **Seller trust indicators**: When available, show seller feedback percentage and review count to help users evaluate seller reliability
5. **Pagination notice**: When total results exceed the current page, inform the user of the total count and suggest pagination to see more
6. **Sponsored items**: Clearly mark sponsored listings so users can distinguish organic results from promoted ones
7. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the issue and suggest adjusting search parameters
8. **Link presentation**: Provide product links so users can view full details on eBay
## Important Limitations

- **No historical data**: This tool returns current live listings only, not historical pricing trends
- **Result cap**: Maximum 200 results per page
- **Rate limiting**: Excessive requests may be throttled; use `noCache: true` sparingly
- **Currency**: Prices are returned in the local currency of the eBay domain being searched
