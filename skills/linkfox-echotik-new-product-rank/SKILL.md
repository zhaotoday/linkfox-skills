# EchoTik - TikTok New Product Ranking

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze the TikTok Shop new product ranking data via the EchoTik data source, helping cross-border e-commerce sellers identify trending new products across TikTok's regional markets.

## Core Concepts

The TikTok New Product Ranking tracks recently listed products that are gaining traction on TikTok Shop. It reveals which new products are selling well, their pricing, sales volume, influencer coverage, and live-stream activity. This is an essential tool for product scouting, trend analysis, and competitive intelligence in the short-video e-commerce space.

**Data scope**: The ranking covers 16 TikTok Shop markets and provides daily snapshots of new products along with their performance metrics (sales volume, revenue, influencer count, video count, live-stream count, commission rate, ratings, and more).

**Pagination**: Results are paginated. Use `pageNum` (page number, starting from 1) and `pageSize` (items per page, default 50) to navigate through the result set.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| date | string | Yes | Query date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| region | string | No | Market region code. Default: `US`. See Supported Markets below |
| pageNum | integer | No | Page number, starting from 1 (default: 1) |
| pageSize | integer | No | Number of products per page (default: 50) |

## Supported Markets

| Code | Market |
|------|--------|
| US | United States |
| GB | United Kingdom |
| ID | Indonesia |
| TH | Thailand |
| PH | Philippines |
| MY | Malaysia |
| VN | Vietnam |
| MX | Mexico |
| SG | Singapore |
| SA | Saudi Arabia |
| BR | Brazil |
| ES | Spain |
| JP | Japan |
| DE | Germany |
| IT | Italy |
| FR | France |

Default market is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a market.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/echotik_list_new_product_rank.py` directly to run queries.

## Usage Examples

**1. Today's trending new products in the US**
Query the US market for the current date to see which new products are gaining traction.
```
date: "2025-06-15", region: "US"
```

**2. Discover hot new products in Southeast Asia**
Check the Indonesian or Thai market for new product opportunities.
```
date: "2025-06-15", region: "ID"
```

**3. Browse the UK market new product ranking**
Scout the UK TikTok Shop for trending new arrivals.
```
date: "2025-06-15", region: "GB"
```

**4. Paginate through a large result set**
Retrieve the second page of 20 results for the US market.
```
date: "2025-06-15", region: "US", pageNum: 2, pageSize: 20
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data only**: Show query results in clear tables without subjective business advice
2. **Sales trend clarification**: When showing sales trend data, translate the numeric flag into human-readable labels: 0 = Stable, 1 = Rising, 2 = Declining
3. **Currency awareness**: Always display prices alongside their currency code since different markets use different currencies
4. **Volume notice**: When results are large, show a summary of the top products and remind users they can paginate for more results
5. **Image handling**: If product image URLs are available, mention them but do not attempt to render images inline unless the environment supports it
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason and suggest adjusting the date or region parameters
## Important Limitations

- **Date required**: The `date` parameter is mandatory; there is no default date
- **Daily granularity**: Data is a daily snapshot, not weekly or monthly
- **Pagination**: Use `pageNum` and `pageSize` to navigate large result sets; not all products are returned in a single call

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- TikTok Shop new product discovery and trend analysis:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "What new products are trending on TikTok" | New product ranking lookup |
| "TikTok bestsellers today", "hot products on TikTok Shop" | Daily ranking query |
| "New product opportunities in Southeast Asia TikTok" | Regional market scouting |
| "Which new items are selling well on TikTok UK" | Region-specific ranking |
| "TikTok product scouting", "short-video e-commerce trends" | General product discovery |
| "Show me rising new products on TikTok" | Trend-filtered ranking |
| "TikTok influencer product picks", "what are TikTok creators promoting" | Influencer-driven product discovery |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond TikTok new product rankings:

- Amazon product research or ABA keyword data
- TikTok advertising / ad campaign management
- TikTok content creation or video editing
- Product reviews or listing copywriting
- Historical trend analysis spanning many months (this tool provides daily snapshots)
- Profit margin calculations or pricing strategy

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "product research" or "what's selling well", if the context clearly involves TikTok Shop or short-video e-commerce, this skill applies. If they are asking about Amazon, Shopify, or other platforms, it does not apply.

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
