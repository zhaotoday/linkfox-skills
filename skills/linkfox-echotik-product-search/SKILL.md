# EchoTik TikTok Product Search

This skill guides you on how to search and analyze TikTok Shop product data, helping sellers and marketers discover product opportunities, evaluate sales performance, and identify influencer-driven products on TikTok.

## Core Concepts

EchoTik is a TikTok Shop analytics platform that tracks product performance across multiple TikTok marketplaces. This tool provides keyword-based product search with rich filtering capabilities, returning detailed product data including sales volumes (1d/7d/15d/30d/60d/90d/total), GMV (revenue), pricing, ratings, review counts, commission rates, and influencer promotion statistics.

**Sales metrics**: Products include multi-period sales data — 1-day, 7-day, 15-day, 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and total sales. The same granularity applies to GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) amounts.

**Commission rate**: Stored as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 means 5%). When a user specifies a percentage, convert it to decimal before passing to the API.

**Listing date**: The `firstCrawlDt` field uses a compact integer format `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `20240101` for January 1, 2024).

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/echotik_list_product.py` directly to run queries.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic Keyword Search — Find top-selling products for a keyword**
```json
{
  "keyword": "phone case",
  "region": "US",
  "productSortField": 1,
  "sortType": 1,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

**2. High-Commission Product Discovery — Products with commission >= 10%**
```json
{
  "keyword": "beauty",
  "region": "US",
  "minProductCommissionRate": 0.10,
  "productSortField": 5,
  "sortType": 1
}
```

**3. New & Trending Products — Recently listed with strong 30-day sales**

}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in organized tables with key columns — product name, price, total sales, 30-day sales, GMV, rating, commission rate, and number of promoting influencers
2. **Currency awareness**: Include the currency field from the response when displaying prices and GMV
3. **Commission formatting**: Display commission rates as percentages for readability (e.g., show 0.05 as "5%")
4. **Volume notice**: When results have a large `total` count, show the current page data and inform the user of total available records; suggest adjusting filters or pagination to explore more
5. **Image reference**: If `imageUrl` or `coverUrl` is present, mention it so the user knows product images are available
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the response and suggest adjusting parameters
7. **Keyword translation reminder**: When the user targets a non-English marketplace, remind them that the keyword should be in the local language of that marketplace for best results
## Applicable Scenarios

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Find trending products on TikTok" | Keyword search sorted by sales |
| "TikTok products with high commission" | Filter by commission rate |
| "What's selling well on TikTok Shop US" | Regional product search by sales |
| "New products blowing up on TikTok" | Filter by listing date + sales |
| "Which products have many influencers promoting them" | Filter by influencer count |
| "Cheap but high-volume TikTok products" | Filter by price + sales |
| "TikTok product research for Southeast Asia" | Search specific SE Asian regions |
| "Products with good reviews on TikTok" | Filter by rating + review count |

## Not Applicable Scenarios

- TikTok influencer/creator analytics (follower counts, engagement rates of creators)
- TikTok video performance analytics (views, likes, shares on specific videos)
- TikTok advertising / ad campaign management
- Amazon, Shopee, or other non-TikTok platform product data
- TikTok Shop store-level analytics
- Product listing creation or optimization advice
- Logistics, fulfillment, or shipping analysis

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "product research" or "what should I sell on TikTok", if it involves searching and filtering products by sales data, pricing, or commission rates on TikTok Shop, then this skill applies. If they're asking about content strategy, video creation, or influencer outreach, it does not apply.
