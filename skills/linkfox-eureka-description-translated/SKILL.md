# Eureka Patent Description Translation

This skill guides you on how to retrieve translated patent description (specification) text via the Eureka patent data platform. It supports translation into Chinese, English, or Japanese, and can look up patents by patent ID or publication number.

## Core Concepts

A patent description (also called "specification") is the full technical text of a patent document. This tool fetches the **translated** version of that text from the Eureka patent database, supporting three target languages: Chinese (`cn`), English (`en`), and Japanese (`jp`).

When a patent's description is unavailable, the tool can optionally substitute it with a description from a **patent family member** (a related patent filed in another jurisdiction covering the same invention).

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| patentId | string | Conditionally | Patent ID. At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided. If both are given, `patentId` takes priority. Multiple values separated by commas; max 100. |
| patentNumber | string | Conditionally | Publication (announcement) number. At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided. Multiple values separated by commas; max 100. |
| lang | string | No | Target translation language. Supported values: `en` (English, default), `cn` (Chinese), `jp` (Japanese). |
| replaceByRelated | integer | No | Whether to substitute with a patent family member's description when the original is unavailable. `1` = yes, `0` = no (default). |

### Key Rules

1. **At least one identifier required**: Either `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided. If the user gives a publication number like "US10123456B2", use `patentNumber`. If they give a numeric patent ID, use `patentId`.
2. **Priority**: When both identifiers are supplied, `patentId` takes precedence.
3. **Batch queries**: Up to 100 patents can be queried at once by passing comma-separated values.
4. **Default language**: If the user does not specify a language, default to `en` (English).

## Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| total | Number of patent records returned |
| data | Array of patent objects (see below) |
| data[].patentId | Internal patent ID |
| data[].pn | Publication (announcement) number |
| data[].description | Translated patent description text |
| data[].pnRelated | Publication number of the substitute family patent (only present when family replacement was used) |
| costToken | Tokens consumed by this request |

## Usage Examples

**1. Get English translation of a patent description by publication number**
```
Get the English description for patent US10123456B2.
```
Parameters: `patentNumber = "US10123456B2"`, `lang = "en"`

**2. Get Chinese translation of a patent description by patent ID**
```
Get the Chinese translation of description for patent ID abc123def.
```
Parameters: `patentId = "abc123def"`, `lang = "cn"`

**3. Batch query with family member fallback**
```
Get English descriptions for US10123456B2, EP3456789A1, CN112345678A. Use family patents if unavailable.
```
Parameters: `patentNumber = "US10123456B2,EP3456789A1,CN112345678A"`, `lang = "en"`, `replaceByRelated = 1`

**4. Japanese translation of a specific patent**
```
Translate the description of JP2021012345A to Japanese.
```
Parameters: `patentNumber = "JP2021012345A"`, `lang = "jp"`

**5. Chinese translation with family fallback**
```
查询专利US10123456B2的中文说明书，如果没有就用同族专利替代。
```
Parameters: `patentNumber = "US10123456B2"`, `lang = "cn"`, `replaceByRelated = 1`

## Display Rules

1. **Present the translated text clearly**: Show the patent description text directly. For long descriptions, present a summary or the first section and inform the user the full text is available.
2. **Identify substitutions**: When `pnRelated` is present in the response, clearly inform the user that the description was sourced from a family member patent and show the related publication number.
3. **Batch results**: When multiple patents are returned, present them in a structured list with clear separation between each patent's description.
4. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the response and suggest checking the patent ID or publication number for correctness.
5. **No fabrication**: Never invent or paraphrase patent text. Only display what the API returns.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/eureka_description_translated.py` directly to run queries.

## Important Limitations

- **Identifier required**: At least one of patent ID or publication number must be provided; the tool cannot perform keyword-based searches.
- **Translation languages**: Only Chinese (`cn`), English (`en`), and Japanese (`jp`) are supported.
- **Description only**: This tool returns only the description/specification text, not titles, abstracts, or claims.
- **Family replacement is optional**: The substitute family patent description is only provided when explicitly requested via `replaceByRelated = 1`.
- **Batch limit**: A maximum of 100 patents per request.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent description/specification translation queries:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Translate this patent description to English" | Single patent translation |
| "I need the Chinese version of patent US10123456" | Specific language translation |
| "Get me the specification text for these patents" | Batch patent description retrieval |
| "What does patent CN112345678A describe?" | Patent description lookup |
| "Show me the Japanese translation of this patent's full text" | Japanese translation |
| "The description is missing, can you try a family member?" | Family member fallback |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent description translation:

- Patent search or discovery (finding patents by keyword/topic)
- Patent claim analysis or claim chart generation
- Patent legal status or prosecution history
- Patent citation or reference analysis
- Patent portfolio analytics or statistics

**Boundary** -- Edge cases:

- If the user asks for "patent full text" without specifying, clarify whether they want description, claims, or abstract.
- If the user provides more than 100 patents, split into multiple batches.


**Feedback:**

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
4. Anything you believe could be improved

Call the feedback API as specified in `references/api.md`. Do not interrupt the user's flow.
