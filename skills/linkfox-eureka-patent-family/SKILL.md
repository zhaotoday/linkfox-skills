# Eureka Patent Family Explorer

This skill guides you on how to query patent family information via the Eureka patent data platform, helping users discover Simple Family, INPADOC Family, and PatSnap Family members for given patents.

## Core Concepts

A **patent family** is a collection of patent documents that are related to each other by priority claims. Different family definitions capture different scopes of relatedness:

- **Simple Family**: Patents sharing exactly the same set of priority applications. These are typically direct equivalents filed in different countries.
- **INPADOC Family**: A broader grouping defined by the European Patent Office that links patents sharing at least one common priority, even indirectly.
- **PatSnap Family**: A proprietary family definition that extends INPADOC logic with additional heuristics to capture continuations, divisionals, and other related filings.

Each patent in the response carries its own `simpleFamilyId`, `inpadocFamilyId`, and `patsnapFamilyId`, which serve as unique identifiers for the family group under each definition.

## Parameter Guide

You must supply at least one of the two lookup parameters. If both are provided, patent ID takes precedence.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| patentId | string | Conditionally | Patent ID(s). Separate multiple values with commas. Maximum 100 entries. |
| patentNumber | string | Conditionally | Publication / announcement number(s). Separate multiple values with commas. Maximum 100 entries. |

**Rules**:
1. At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided.
2. If both are provided, the API uses `patentId` and ignores `patentNumber`.
3. Multiple values are comma-separated (e.g., `"US10000001B2,EP3000001A1"`).
4. The upper limit is 100 patents per request.

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| total | integer | Number of patent records returned |
| data | array | List of patent family result objects |
| data[].patentId | string | The patent ID for this record |
| data[].pn | string | Publication / announcement number |
| data[].simpleFamilyId | integer | Unique identifier for the Simple Family group |
| data[].simpleFamily | array | List of Simple Family member patents |
| data[].inpadocFamilyId | integer | Unique identifier for the INPADOC Family group |
| data[].inpadocFamily | array | List of INPADOC Family member patents |
| data[].patsnapFamilyId | integer | Unique identifier for the PatSnap Family group |
| data[].patsnapFamily | array | List of PatSnap Family member patents |
| columns | array | Column definitions for rendering |
| costToken | integer | Tokens consumed by this request |
| type | string | Rendering style hint |

## Usage Examples

**1. Look up family members by publication number**
> "Find the patent family for US10000001B2"

Call with:
```json
{"patentNumber": "US10000001B2"}
```

**2. Look up families for multiple patents at once**
> "Show the INPADOC family for these patents: EP3000001A1, CN112345678A, JP2020123456A"

Call with:
```json
{"patentNumber": "EP3000001A1,CN112345678A,JP2020123456A"}
```

**3. Look up by patent ID**
> "Get the patent family for patent ID 5af83e12-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

Call with:
```json
{"patentId": "5af83e12-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}
```

**4. Compare family scopes**
> "I want to see how Simple Family vs. INPADOC Family differs for US20200012345A1"

Call with:
```json
{"patentNumber": "US20200012345A1"}
```
Then compare `simpleFamily` and `inpadocFamily` arrays in the response.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show patent family results in well-structured tables. Group by family type (Simple, INPADOC, PatSnap) when the user asks for comparison.
2. **Summarize counts**: Always state how many family members were found under each family type so users can quickly gauge geographic spread.
3. **Highlight jurisdictions**: When listing family members, call out the countries/regions covered to help users understand the patent's geographic protection scope.
4. **Error handling**: When the API returns an error or empty results, explain the likely cause (invalid patent number format, patent not found in database, etc.) and suggest corrections.
5. **Batch result organization**: When querying multiple patents, organize results per patent so users can easily find each one.

## Important Limitations

- **Lookup only**: This tool retrieves family information for known patents. It cannot perform keyword-based patent searches or full-text queries.
- **Batch limit**: A maximum of 100 patent IDs or publication numbers per request.
- **Data source**: Family data comes from the Eureka patent platform and may have a slight delay relative to the very latest patent office publications.
- **Family member detail**: The family member arrays contain summary objects. For full bibliographic data on a specific family member, a separate lookup may be required.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent family and equivalents lookup:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Patent family for XX" | Direct family lookup |
| "What are the equivalents of this patent" | Simple family search |
| "Which countries is this patent filed in" | Geographic coverage via family |
| "INPADOC family members" | Broad family lookup |
| "Related patents / sibling patents" | Family exploration |
| "Compare simple vs extended family" | Multi-definition comparison |
| "Batch check families for these patents" | Bulk family lookup |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent family lookup:
- Full-text patent search by keywords or classification codes
- Patent valuation or litigation data
- Freedom-to-operate or infringement analysis
- Patent application filing or prosecution


**Feedback:**

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
4. Anything you believe could be improved

Call the feedback API as specified in `references/api.md`. Do not interrupt the user's flow.

## Handling Large Responses

To avoid overflowing the agent context, persist the response to disk and extract only the fields you need:

```
python scripts/response_io.py run --script scripts/eureka_patent_family.py --out-dir <DIR> '<params>'
python scripts/response_io.py read <file> --fields "<paths>"   # or --path "<JMESPath>"
```

> Pick `--out-dir` outside any git working tree (e.g. `/tmp/...` on Unix, `%TEMP%/...` on Windows). Persisted responses may contain PII, pricing, or auth-sensitive data — do not commit them. Files are not auto-deleted; clean up when the task is done.

`run` writes the full response to a file and emits only a schema preview + file path. `read` projects specific fields, with `--limit/--offset` for slicing and `--format json|jsonl|csv|table` for output.

**When to prefer this pattern** — apply your judgment based on the response characteristics, e.g.:
- High field count per record, or fields you don't need
- Batch/paginated results (multiple items per call)
- Long-text fields (descriptions, reviews, HTML, time series)
- Output reused across later steps rather than consumed immediately

For small, single-use responses, calling the main script directly is fine.

⚠️ The preview is a truncated schema + sample, not the full data. Any field-level decision must read from the persisted file via `read`.
