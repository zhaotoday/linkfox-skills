# Eureka Patent Image Search (Single Image)

This skill guides you on how to perform patent image search (search-by-image) via the Eureka patent platform. Given a single image URL, it finds visually similar patents in the design or utility patent databases, supporting multiple search models and extensive filtering options.

## Core Concepts

The Eureka Patent Image Search tool enables visual similarity search across patent databases:

1. **Search Models** — Four models are available depending on the patent type and search intent:
   - Model 1: Design smart association — finds design patents with intelligent visual association
   - Model 2: Design search this image — exact visual match for design patents
   - Model 3: Utility match shape — matches utility patents by shape/contour
   - Model 4: Utility match shape + pattern + color — matches utility patents by shape, pattern, and color combined

2. **Patent Types** — Two patent types are supported:
   - `D` (Design) — search within design/industrial design patents (use models 1 or 2)
   - `U` (Utility) — search within utility model patents (use models 3 or 4)

3. **Filtering** — Extensive optional filters for country/authority, Locarno classification, date ranges, legal status, assignees, and keyword fields.

4. **Scoring** — Results include a similarity `score` and can be sorted by score, application date, publication date, or issue date.

| isHttps | integer | — | Return image URLs with HTTPS (1) or HTTP (0) |
| returnImgId | boolean | — | Include image ID in results |

### Model & Patent Type Combinations

| Patent Type | Recommended Models | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| D (Design) | 1, 2 | Model 1 for smart association, Model 2 for exact visual match |
| U (Utility) | 3, 4 | Model 3 for shape match, Model 4 for shape + pattern + color |

## Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| patentId | The patent's internal ID |
| patentPn | Publication number |
| title | Patent title |
| url | URL of the similar image found in the patent |
| score | Similarity score |
| apdt | Application date |
| pbdt | Publication date |
| authority | Patent authority (country code) |

| currentAssignee | Current rights holder |
| loc | Array of Locarno classification codes |
| imgId | Image ID (when returnImgId is enabled) |
| locMatch | Whether the Locarno classification matched the filter |
| total | Number of results in current page |
| allRecordsCount | Total number of matching results |
| costToken | Token cost for this query |

## Usage Examples

**1. Search for similar design patents using an image**
```
Search for design patents similar to this image: https://example.com/product-image.jpg — look in CN and US patent databases.
```
→ Use model=1 or 2, patentType="D", country="CN,US"

**2. Find utility patents with a similar shape**
```
Find utility patents that have a similar shape to this product image: https://example.com/gadget.png
```
→ Use model=3, patentType="U"

**3. Search with date and legal status filters**
```
Search for valid design patents similar to this image, filed after 2020, in the CN database: https://example.com/design.jpg
```
→ Use model=2, patentType="D", country="CN", applyStartTime="20200101", simpleLegalStatus="1"

**4. Search with Locarno classification**
```
Find design patents in LOC 14-01 similar to this product: https://example.com/phone-case.jpg
```
→ Use model=1, patentType="D", loc="14-01"

**5. Search with keyword and assignee filters**
```
Search for design patents similar to this image from Apple Inc.: https://example.com/device.jpg
```
→ Use model=2, patentType="D", assignees="Apple"

**6. Get more results with pagination**
```
Show me the next 20 design patents similar to this image: https://example.com/product.jpg
```
→ Use limit=20, offset=20

## Display Rules

1. **Present results as a visual gallery when possible**: Show the patent publication number, title, similarity score, and image URL for each result.
2. **Score interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater visual similarity. Present scores as percentages or relative rankings for user clarity.
3. **Key metadata**: Always include patent number, title, authority, application date, and assignee for each result.
4. **Total count**: Mention `allRecordsCount` to indicate how many total matches were found, and how many are displayed.
5. **Model explanation**: When presenting results, briefly note which search model was used so the user understands the matching approach.
6. **Error handling**: If the query fails, check common issues: invalid image URL, unsupported image format, invalid model/patentType combination.
7. **Pagination guidance**: If there are more results than displayed, inform the user they can request more.

## Important Limitations

- **Single image only**: This endpoint accepts one image URL per request.
- **Image URL must be publicly accessible**: Private or authentication-required image URLs will fail.
- **Model & patent type pairing**: Models 1–2 are for design patents (D), models 3–4 are for utility patents (U). Mismatched combinations may produce poor results.
- **Offset limit**: Maximum offset is 1000, meaning at most 1000 + limit results can be accessed via pagination.
- **Locarno classification**: The `loc` parameter uses Locarno codes; users may need help identifying the correct code for their product category.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** — Visual patent search queries:

| User Says | Scenario |

| "Find valid patents similar to this design" | Legal status-filtered search |
| "Show me more results" | Pagination request |
| "Search in Locarno class 14-01" | Classification-filtered search |
