# FastMoss - TikTok Product Search

This skill guides you on how to search and filter TikTok Shop product data using FastMoss, helping sellers and marketers discover product opportunities, evaluate sales performance, and identify influencer-driven products across 15 TikTok markets worldwide.

## Core Concepts

FastMoss is a well-known TikTok e-commerce data platform that tracks product performance across multiple TikTok marketplaces. This tool provides keyword-based product search with rich filtering capabilities, returning detailed product data including multi-period sales (7-day/28-day/90-day/total), GMV (revenue), pricing, ratings, review counts, commission rates, influencer promotion statistics, and shop information.

**Sales metrics**: Products include multi-period sales data — 7-day, 28-day, 90-day, and total sales. The same granularity applies to GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) amounts.

**Commission rate**: Stored as a decimal (e.g., 0.10 means 10%). When displaying to the user, convert to percentage format.

**Shop types**: Products can be filtered by shop type — local shops (1) or cross-border shops (2). The `isCrossBorder` field (1=cross-border, 0=local) and `isSShopText` field (TikTok fully-managed shop) provide additional shop classification.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic Keyword Search — Find top-selling products**
```json
{
  "keyword": "phone case",
  "region": "US",
  "orderField": "total_units_sold",
  "pageSize": 10
}
```

**2. High-Commission Product Discovery — Products with commission >= 10%**
```json
{
  "keyword": "beauty",
  "region": "US",
  "commissionRateRange": {"min": 0.10},
  "orderField": "commission_rate"
}
```

**3. Cross-Border Shop Products — Filter by shop type**

## Display Rules

1. **Present data only**: Show query results in organized tables with key columns — product name, price, total sales, 7-day sales, GMV, rating, commission rate, and number of promoting influencers. Do not make subjective business advice
2. **Commission formatting**: Commission rate is a decimal (0.10 = 10%) — always display as percentage for readability
3. **Cross-border awareness**: `isCrossBorder`: 1 = cross-border shop, 0 = local shop. Display clearly
4. **Currency awareness**: Include the currency field from the response when displaying prices and GMV
5. **Trend labels**: Display `salesTrendFlagText` directly as the trend indicator
6. **Shop flags**: Display `freeShippingText` and `isSShopText` directly (values are readable text)
7. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the response and suggest adjusting parameters

## Important Limitations

- No required parameters (all optional), but at minimum provide keyword or category for meaningful results
- Max 10 items per page

## Applicable Scenarios

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Find trending products on TikTok" | Keyword search sorted by sales |
| "TikTok products with high commission" | Filter by commission rate range |
| "What's selling well on TikTok Shop US" | Regional product search by sales |
| "Search TikTok cross-border shop products" | Filter by shopType=2 |
| "Which products have many influencers promoting them" | Filter by creator count range |
| "TikTok fully-managed shop products" | Filter with isSshop=true |
| "TikTok product research for Southeast Asia" | Search specific SE Asian regions |
| "New hot-selling products on TikTok" | Use isTopSelling + isNewListed flags |
| "FastMoss product data" | Direct platform reference |

## Not Applicable Scenarios

- TikTok influencer/creator analytics (follower counts, engagement rates of creators)
- TikTok video performance analytics (views, likes, shares on specific videos)
- TikTok advertising / ad campaign management
- Amazon, Shopee, or other non-TikTok platform product data
- TikTok Shop store-level analytics
- Product listing creation or optimization advice
- Logistics, fulfillment, or shipping analysis

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "product research" or "what should I sell on TikTok", if it involves searching and filtering products by sales data, pricing, or commission rates on TikTok Shop, then this skill applies. If they're asking about content strategy, video creation, or influencer outreach, it does not apply.
