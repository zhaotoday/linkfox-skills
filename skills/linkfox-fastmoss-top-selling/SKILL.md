# FastMoss - TikTok Top Selling Rankings

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze the TikTok top selling product rankings via the FastMoss data source, helping cross-border e-commerce sellers identify hot-selling products across TikTok's global markets by day, week, or month.

## Core Concepts

The TikTok Top Selling Ranking tracks the best-performing products on TikTok Shop across 9 global markets. It reveals which products are leading in sales volume, GMV, and growth rate over configurable time windows (daily, weekly, monthly). This is an essential tool for product scouting, trend analysis, and competitive intelligence in TikTok e-commerce.

**Data scope**: The ranking covers 9 TikTok Shop markets and supports three time granularities — day, week, and month — via the `dateInfo` parameter. Each product entry includes sales volume, GMV, growth rate, commission rate, shop information, category, and more.

**dateInfo format is important**:
- type: `"day"` -> value: `"2025-02-01"` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- type: `"week"` -> value: `"2025-18"` (year-weekNumber)
- type: `"month"` -> value: `"2025-02"` (year-month)

**Pagination**: Results are paginated. Use `page` (page number, starting from 1) and `pageSize` (items per page, max 10, default 10) to navigate through the result set.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| region | string | Yes | Market region code (US, GB, MX, ES, ID, VN, MY, TH, PH) |
| dateInfo | object | Yes | Date specification with `type` (day/week/month) and `value` (see format above) |
| category | string | No | Category name in English, matched to TikTok category ID. Non-English input should be translated first |
| orderby | object | No | Sorting: `field` (units_sold/gmv/total_units_sold/total_gmv/growth_rate) + `order` (desc/asc). Default: desc |
| page | integer | No | Page number, default 1 |
| pageSize | integer | No | Items per page, max 10, default 10 |

## Supported Markets

| Code | Market |
|------|--------|
| US | United States |
| GB | United Kingdom |
| MX | Mexico |
| ES | Spain |
| ID | Indonesia |
| VN | Vietnam |

Default market is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a market.

## API Usage

## Display Rules

1. **Present data only**: Show query results in clear tables without subjective business advice
2. **Growth rate**: Growth rate is in percentage -- show with % sign
3. **Commission rate**: Commission rate is in basis points (1000 = 10%) -- convert to percentage for display
4. **Currency awareness**: Always display currency alongside prices since different markets use different currencies
5. **dateInfo format**: Validate and remind users of the correct format for the selected time granularity
6. **Delisted status**: `offShelvesText` value "是" means delisted, "否" means active -- clarify this for users

## Important Limitations

- **dateInfo is mandatory**: Both `type` and `value` must be provided with specific format requirements
- **No keyword search**: This tool does NOT support keyword search (use linkfox-fastmoss-product-search for that)
- **Max 10 items per page**: The `pageSize` parameter cannot exceed 10
- **Data delay**: Data has T+1 statistical delay

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- TikTok top selling product rankings and trend analysis:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "What are the top selling products on TikTok" | Top selling ranking lookup |
| "TikTok bestsellers this week", "hot products on TikTok Shop" | Weekly/daily ranking query |
| "TikTok GMV ranking", "highest revenue products on TikTok" | GMV-based ranking |
| "TikTok category hot sellers", "top selling beauty products on TikTok" | Category-specific ranking |
| "TikTok weekly product report", "monthly top sellers" | Time-dimension analysis |
| "FastMoss top selling", "FastMoss ranking data" | Direct data source reference |
| "Which products are growing fastest on TikTok" | Growth rate sorted ranking |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond TikTok top selling rankings:

- Amazon product research or ABA keyword data
- TikTok advertising / ad campaign management
- TikTok content creation or video editing
- Product reviews or listing copywriting
- TikTok product keyword search (use linkfox-fastmoss-product-search instead)
- Profit margin calculations or pricing strategy

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "product research" or "what's selling well", if the context clearly involves TikTok Shop or TikTok e-commerce rankings, this skill applies. If they are asking about Amazon, Shopify, or other platforms, it does not apply. If they want to search products by keyword rather than browse rankings, use linkfox-fastmoss-product-search instead.

1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
