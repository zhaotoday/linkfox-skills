# Jiimore Niche Market Info

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze Amazon niche market data via the Jiimore data service, helping Amazon sellers gain deep insights into specific niche markets including competition, pricing, reviews, and growth trends.

## Core Concepts

A **niche market** in Jiimore represents a fine-grained product segment on Amazon. Each niche is identified by a unique `nicheId`. This tool retrieves comprehensive market intelligence for a single niche at a time, covering:

- **Market overview**: niche title, demand score, product count, brand count, selling partner count
- **Pricing**: average price, minimum price, maximum price
- **Search & conversion**: weekly/quarterly search volume, search volume growth, search conversion rate, click-to-sale conversion rate, units sold
- **Competition concentration**: top 5 / top 20 product and brand click share (current, 90-day, 360-day snapshots)
- **Product launches**: new products launched, successful launches across 90-day / 180-day / 360-day windows
- **Inventory health**: average out-of-stock rate over time
- **Seller maturity**: average brand age, average selling partner age
- **Review insights**: average review rating, average review count, positive and negative customer review insights
- **Advertising**: ACOS (advertising cost of sales), sponsored products percentage
- **Profitability**: profit margin > 50% SKU ratio, break-even ratio, return rate

**Supported marketplaces**: US (United States), JP (Japan), DE (Germany). Default is **US**.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| nicheId | string | Yes | The niche market ID to query. Maximum 1000 characters. Only one ID per request. |
| countryCode | string | No | Marketplace code. Allowed values: `US`, `JP`, `DE`. Defaults to `US`. |

### How to Use Parameters

1. **nicheId is mandatory**: The user must provide or you must identify the niche market ID. This is a string identifier for a specific Amazon niche segment.
2. **countryCode defaults to US**: Only specify a different value when the user explicitly mentions Japan (`JP`) or Germany (`DE`).
3. **Single ID per call**: This tool only supports one niche ID per request. If the user wants to compare multiple niches, make separate calls.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic niche market lookup (US)**
Query niche market data for a given niche ID in the US marketplace:
```
nicheId: "12345678"
countryCode: "US"
```

**2. Query a niche in the Japan marketplace**
```
nicheId: "87654321"
countryCode: "JP"
```

**3. Query a niche in the Germany marketplace**
```
nicheId: "11223344"
countryCode: "DE"
```

## Analysis Guidance

When presenting results, organize the rich data into logical sections for the user:

### Market Overview

- Demand score, product count, brand count, selling partner count
- Reference ASIN image (if available)

### Pricing & Profitability
- Average price, min price, max price
- Profit margin > 50% SKU ratio, break-even ratio, return rate
- ACOS

### Search & Demand Trends
- Weekly and quarterly search volume and growth rates
- Search conversion rate, click conversion rate
- Units sold (weekly/quarterly)

### Competition Landscape
- Top 5 and top 20 product/brand click share (current vs. 90-day vs. 360-day)
- Brand count trends, selling partner count trends
- Sponsored products percentage over time

### Product Launch Activity

- Launch success rate (semiannual)

### Review & Customer Insights

### Inventory & Operations

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in well-structured tables or grouped sections without subjective business advice unless specifically requested.
2. **Trend comparison**: When the response includes current, 90-day-ago, and 360-day-ago data points, present them side-by-side so users can easily spot trends.
3. **Percentage formatting**: Display share and rate values as percentages (e.g., 0.35 as 35.0%).
4. **Review insights**: If positive/negative customer review insights are present, list them as bullet points.
5. **Image display**: If `referenceAsinImageUrl` is present, display or link to the niche reference image.
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the response and suggest checking the niche ID or country code.
## Important Limitations

- **Single ID only**: Only one niche ID can be queried per request. Batch queries are not supported.
- **Three marketplaces**: Only US, JP, and DE are supported.
- **Niche ID required**: The user must supply the niche ID; this tool cannot search for niches by keyword or category.
