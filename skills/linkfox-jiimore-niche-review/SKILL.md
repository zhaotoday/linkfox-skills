# Jiimore Niche Review from Keyword

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze Amazon niche market review data powered by Jiimore, helping Amazon sellers uncover consumer sentiment, pain points, and real demand signals from product reviews within niche markets.

## Core Concepts

Niche Review Analysis aggregates and categorizes customer reviews across products in an Amazon niche market. Given a keyword, the system identifies the relevant niche markets, extracts review topics, classifies them as positive or negative, and shows how frequently each topic is mentioned. This enables sellers to understand what customers love, what frustrates them, and where product improvement opportunities exist.

**Review types**: Each review entry is classified as either "positive" or "negative", reflecting the overall sentiment of that review topic.

**Mention percentage**: The `percentOfMentions` value (0-1 scale, representing 0%-100%) indicates how frequently a particular topic appears across all reviews in the niche. A higher percentage means more customers are talking about that topic.

## Supported Marketplaces

US (United States), JP (Japan), DE (Germany)

Default marketplace is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a marketplace.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/jiimore_get_niche_review.py` directly to run queries.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show review topics in a well-organized table. Include the niche name, review type (positive/negative), topic, mention percentage, and a review example
2. **Percentage formatting**: Convert 0-1 scale values to percentages for display (e.g., 0.15 -> 15%)
3. **Sentiment separation**: When presenting results, group or clearly label positive vs. negative reviews so users can quickly identify opportunities and pain points
4. **Actionable insight framing**: While showing data objectively, highlight high-mention-percentage negative reviews as potential product improvement opportunities, and high-mention-percentage positive reviews as features to emphasize in listings
5. **Volume notice**: When results are large, show the most relevant data first and remind users about pagination options
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason and suggest adjusting the keyword or filter criteria
7. **Language reminder**: If a user provides a keyword in the wrong language for the target marketplace, remind them to use the marketplace's native language (English for US, German for DE, Japanese for JP)
## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Consumer review and sentiment analysis within Amazon niche markets:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "What do customers say about XX" | Niche review topic lookup |
| "Customer pain points for XX" | Negative review analysis |
| "What features do buyers love in XX" | Positive review analysis |
| "Review sentiment for XX niche" | Full sentiment breakdown |
| "Consumer demand insights for XX" | Demand signal extraction from reviews |
| "Common complaints about XX products" | Negative topic mining |
| "What makes XX products popular" | Positive topic mining |
| "Niche market review analysis" | General niche review exploration |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond niche review analysis:
- Individual ASIN review analysis (this tool works at the niche/market level)
- Keyword search volume trends without review context (use ABA data tools instead)
- Product listing optimization or copywriting
- Advertising strategy and PPC management
- Sales estimation or revenue forecasting

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "market research" or "product opportunity", if their intent focuses on understanding consumer sentiment, review topics, and pain points within a niche market, this skill applies. If they are asking about search volume trends, pricing strategy, or sales data without review context, it does not apply.

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
