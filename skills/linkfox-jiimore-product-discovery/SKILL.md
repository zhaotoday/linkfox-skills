# Jiimore Product Discovery

This skill guides you on how to discover and mine high-potential Amazon products using the Jiimore product discovery engine, helping Amazon sellers find potential bestsellers through keyword-based filtering with conversion, click growth, and profitability indicators.

## Core Concepts

Jiimore Product Discovery is a keyword-driven Amazon product mining tool. Given a search keyword, it returns a list of products matching specified performance criteria such as conversion rate, click growth rate, gross profit margin, pricing, reviews, and listing age. This makes it ideal for identifying emerging opportunities, validating product ideas, and competitive benchmarking.

**Keyword is required**: Every query must include a `keyword`. The keyword should be translated into the language of the target marketplace (e.g., Japanese for JP, German for DE).

**Rate values are decimals**: Conversion rates and growth rates are expressed as decimals between 0 and 1. For example, `0.1` means 10%, `0.25` means 25%. This is a common point of confusion when users specify percentages.

**Marketplace support**: Currently supports US (United States), JP (Japan), and DE (Germany). Default is **US**. Use US when the user doesn't specify a marketplace.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/jiimore_product_discovery.py` directly to run queries.

## Usage Examples

**1. Find high-conversion wireless chargers in the US market**
```json
{
  "keyword": "wireless charger",
  "countryCode": "US",
  "clickConversionRateMin": 0.1,
  "sortField": "clickConversionRate",
  "sortType": "desc"
}
```

**2. Discover fast-growing new products (listed within the last 6 months, weekly click growth > 20%)**
```json
{
  "keyword": "desk lamp",
  "countryCode": "US",
  "launchDateMin": "20250901000000",
  "clickCountGrowthT7Min": 0.2,
  "sortField": "clickCountGrowthT7",
  "sortType": "desc"
}
```

**3. Find underpriced high-margin products with low competition (few reviews)**
```json
{
  "keyword": "phone stand",
  "countryCode": "US",
  "priceMin": 10,
  "priceMax": 30,
  "totalReviewsMax": 100,
  "grossProfitMarginMin": 0.3,
  "sortField": "gpm",
  "sortType": "desc"
}
```

**4. Mine products from Chinese sellers with strong monthly click growth in the German market**
```json
{
  "keyword": "Handyhuelle",
  "countryCode": "DE",
  "sellerCountry": "CN",
  "clickCountGrowthT30Min": 0.15,
  "sortField": "clickCountGrowthT30",
  "sortType": "desc"
}
```

**5. Find high-rated products with strong annual sales in the Japanese market**
```json
{
  "keyword": "ワイヤレスイヤホン",
  "countryCode": "JP",
  "customerRatingMin": 4.0,
  "salesVolumeT360Min": 1000,
  "sortField": "purchasedClicksT360",
  "sortType": "desc"
}
```

**6. Identify niche opportunities with high composite conversion and multiple niche markets**
```json
{
  "keyword": "yoga mat",
  "countryCode": "US",
  "clickConversionRateCompositeMin": 0.15,
  "nicheCountMin": 3,
  "sortField": "clickConversionRateComposite",
  "sortType": "desc"
}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in well-structured tables, including product title, ASIN, price, ratings, conversion rates, click counts, and growth rates
2. **Rate formatting**: Always display rate values as percentages for readability (e.g., show 0.12 as 12%). Remind users that the API accepts decimals (0-1)
3. **Image display**: When product image URLs are available, display the main product image alongside the data
4. **Pagination awareness**: When results span multiple pages, inform the user of the total count and current page, and offer to fetch additional pages
5. **Keyword translation reminder**: Remind users that keywords must be in the target marketplace language (English for US, Japanese for JP, German for DE)
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the response and suggest adjusting query criteria
7. **No subjective advice**: Present factual product data without making subjective business recommendations
## Important Limitations

- **Keyword is mandatory**: Every query requires a keyword; browsing without a keyword is not supported
- **Three marketplaces only**: Currently limited to US, JP, and DE
- **Page size cap**: Maximum 100 results per page
- **Rate values**: All rate/percentage parameters must be passed as decimals (0-1), not percentages
- **Launch date format**: Must follow the `yyyyMMdd000000` format exactly (e.g., `20250101000000`)
