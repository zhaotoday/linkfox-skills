# Keepa Product Data Request

This skill guides you on how to retrieve Amazon product details via the Keepa product request API, helping Amazon sellers and analysts obtain structured product data for one or more ASINs across multiple Amazon marketplaces.

## Core Concepts

The Keepa Product Request API returns detailed product listing data from Amazon, sourced through Keepa. Given one or more ASINs and a marketplace, it returns comprehensive product information: pricing, title, main image, listing date, material, weight, dimensions, sales rank, monthly sales units (current and up to 12 months of history), FBA fees, ratings, review counts, category tree, and more.

**Key points**:
- You can query up to **100 ASINs** in a single request by separating them with commas.
- The `domain` parameter is a numeric marketplace ID (e.g., `1` = Amazon.com US), not a country code.
- Setting `history` to `1` includes historical sales data (monthly sales for up to 12 prior months, average sales rank over 30/90/180 days). Setting it to `0` returns only current product information.
- The response does **not** include product descriptions or reviews content.

## Parameter Guide

### domain (Required)

Numeric Amazon marketplace ID. The mapping is:

| Domain ID | Marketplace |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Amazon.com (US) |
| 2 | Amazon.co.uk (UK) |
| 3 | Amazon.de (Germany) |
| 4 | Amazon.fr (France) |
| 5 | Amazon.co.jp (Japan) |
| 6 | Amazon.ca (Canada) |
| 8 | Amazon.it (Italy) |
| 9 | Amazon.es (Spain) |
| 10 | Amazon.in (India) |
| 11 | Amazon.com.mx (Mexico) |
| 12 | Amazon.com.br (Brazil) |

Default to **1** (US) when the user does not specify a marketplace.

### asin (Required)

One or more Amazon Standard Identification Numbers. For multiple ASINs, separate with commas. Maximum 100 ASINs per request, with a total string length limit of 3000 characters.

### history (Optional)

Whether to include historical data such as monthly sales for the past 12 months and average sales rank over 30/90/180 days. Set to `1` to include history, `0` (default) for basic info only.

## Usage Examples

**1. Single ASIN lookup (US marketplace, basic info)**
```json
{"asin": "B0088PUEPK", "domain": "1"}
```

**2. Single ASIN with historical sales data**
```json
{"asin": "B0088PUEPK", "domain": "1", "history": 1}
```

**3. Batch lookup of multiple ASINs (Germany)**
```json
{"asin": "B0088PUEPK,B00U26V4VQ,B07M68S376", "domain": "3", "history": 1}
```

**4. Product lookup on Amazon Japan**
```json
{"asin": "B09V3KXJPB", "domain": "5", "history": 0}
```

**5. Competitor comparison across multiple ASINs (US, with sales history)**
```json
{"asin": "B0CXYZ1234,B0CXYZ5678,B0CXYZ9012,B0CXYZABCD", "domain": "1", "history": 1}
```

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/keepa_product_detail.py` directly to run queries.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show product details in well-structured tables. Group related fields (e.g., dimensions together, sales data together) for readability.
2. **Price and currency**: Always display the price alongside its currency (e.g., "$29.99 USD"). The `currency` field in the response indicates the local currency.
3. **Sales trend**: When historical data is included, present the 12-month sales trend in a table or describe the trajectory (growing, declining, stable) to help users quickly assess momentum.
4. **Dimensions and weight**: Convert millimeter values to more intuitive units when appropriate (e.g., show both mm and inches, or mm and cm). Note that weight is in grams.
5. **Unavailable data**: Fields with value `0` or `-1` indicate data is unavailable. Do not display these as actual measurements; instead note "N/A" or omit them.
6. **Image display**: If `imageUrl` is present, display the product image to help users visually identify the product.
7. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the issue based on the response and suggest corrections (e.g., invalid ASIN format, unsupported marketplace).
8. **Large batch results**: For batch queries with many ASINs, present a summary table first and offer to show individual product details on request.
## Important Limitations

- **No product descriptions or reviews**: The API does not return product description text or review content.
- **Maximum 100 ASINs per request**: Batch queries are capped at 100 ASINs.
- **ASIN string length limit**: The `asin` parameter has a maximum length of 3000 characters.
- **Historical data is optional**: Monthly sales history is only returned when `history` is set to `1`.
- **Data freshness**: The `lastUpdate` field indicates when the product data was last refreshed.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Product data retrieval by ASIN:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Look up this ASIN", "Get product details for B0XXXXXXXX" | Single ASIN lookup |
| "What's the price of this product on Amazon" | Price query |
| "How many units does this product sell per month" | Monthly sales check |
| "Compare these ASINs", "batch lookup these products" | Multi-ASIN comparison |
| "Show me the sales trend for this ASIN" | Historical sales analysis |
| "What category is this product in" | Category / classification lookup |
| "Product dimensions", "how much does it weigh" | Physical specs query |
| "FBA fees for this product" | Fee estimation |
| "When was this product listed", "listing date" | Listing age / launch date |
| "Is this product FBA or FBM" | Fulfillment method check |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond ASIN-level product data:

- Search term / keyword analysis (use ABA data tools instead)
- Product reviews or listing copywriting content
- Advertising / PPC campaign data
- Seller account or store-level analytics
- Product research without specific ASINs (e.g., "find trending products in kitchen category")
- Price history charts or Buy Box history over time (only current and average rank data are available)

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "product research" or "competitor analysis", if they have specific ASINs and want structured product data (price, sales, dimensions, category), this skill applies. If they want keyword-level analysis, market-wide trends without specific ASINs, or advertising metrics, this skill does not apply.

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
