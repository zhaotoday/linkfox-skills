# Product Main Image Prompt Extractor

This skill guides you on how to extract visual features and prompts from product main images using multimodal AI, helping e-commerce sellers turn unstructured image data into structured, actionable insights.

## Core Concepts

This tool performs deep visual analysis on product main images (and optionally additional images) from a product list. It uses a multimodal AI model to identify specific visual dimensions based on a natural language instruction, such as color, shape, style, material, or specific selling-point elements.

**How it works**: You provide a list of products (with image URLs) and a natural language prompt describing what to extract. The tool automatically iterates over all products, analyzes each image, and returns structured attribute data (`attributeName` + `attributeValue`) appended to each product record.

**Row expansion**: When extracting multiple dimensions in a single request (e.g., both color and shape), each original product row is duplicated per dimension, resulting in one row per product per attribute.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| productImageAnalysisPrompt | Yes | Natural language instruction describing what visual information to extract from the images. Be specific about the dimensions you want (color, material, shape, style, pendant type, etc.). |
| analyzeAdditionalImages | No | Whether to also analyze additional product images beyond the main image. Defaults to `false`. |
| refResultData | No | Reference data from a previous step, containing the product list to analyze. Must be a JSON string with a `products` array. |
| userInput | No | Supplementary user input for additional context. |

### Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Be dimension-specific**: Clearly state what visual attribute(s) to extract. "Extract the dominant color of each product" is better than "Analyze the images."
2. **One or few dimensions per call**: For cleaner results, focus on one or two dimensions at a time.
3. **Use concrete terms**: "Identify the pendant/charm shape on the product" is clearer than "Look at the decorations."
4. **No need to specify individual products**: The tool automatically iterates over all products in the input list.
5. **Data flow dependency**: The tool requires upstream product data. It cannot reference "products from the previous conversation round" -- the data must be explicitly provided via the current step's input or resource references.

### Prompt Examples

| Goal | Example Prompt |
|------|---------------|
| Extract dominant color | "Analyze each product's main image and extract the primary color of the product" |
| Identify material | "From each product's main image, identify the apparent material (plastic, metal, wood, fabric, etc.)" |
| Classify pendant shape | "Analyze each product's main image and identify the shape of the pendant/charm (round, heart, star, etc.)" |
| Detect style | "Extract the overall style of each product from its main image (minimalist, vintage, bohemian, industrial, etc.)" |
| Reverse-engineer image prompt | "Based on the main image, infer the likely AI-generation prompt or visual description that could reproduce this image" |
| Multi-dimension extraction | "From each main image, extract both the dominant color and the overall product shape" |

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/multimodal_extract_attributes.py` directly to run analyses.

## Response Structure

The response enriches the original product list with extracted attributes:

- **products**: An array of product records, each augmented with `attributeName` (the dimension extracted, e.g., "color") and `attributeValue` (the extracted value, e.g., "red"). One record per product per attribute dimension.
- **attributeGroups**: Products grouped by attribute name and value for easy comparison. Each group includes the attribute value, the count of products, and the list of ASINs.
- **columns**: Column definitions for rendering the result table.
- **costToken**: Total tokens consumed by the multimodal AI model.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data in tables**: Show extracted attributes in clear, well-formatted tables with product identifiers (ASIN, title) alongside the extracted attribute values.
2. **Highlight distribution**: When attribute groups are returned, summarize the distribution (e.g., "60% of products are red, 25% blue, 15% green") to give the user a quick overview.
3. **Row expansion notice**: If multiple dimensions were extracted, inform the user that each product appears once per dimension in the results.
4. **Error handling**: When analysis fails, explain the reason based on the response message and suggest adjustments (e.g., ensuring the product list contains valid image URLs).
5. **Data dependency reminder**: If the user tries to reference products from a previous conversation round without explicit data flow, remind them that the product data must come from an upstream step in the current pipeline.
6. **No subjective advice**: Present the extracted visual features factually. Let the user draw their own business conclusions.
## Important Limitations

- **Requires product data input**: The tool cannot operate without a `products` array containing image URLs. It depends on upstream data from a prior step.
- **No fuzzy references**: Cannot analyze "products from the last conversation" -- data must be explicitly piped in via `refResultData` or resource references.
- **Row multiplication**: Extracting N dimensions from M products produces up to M x N rows in the output.
- **Image accessibility**: Product image URLs must be publicly accessible for the analysis to succeed.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Visual feature extraction and image analysis for product listings:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "What colors are these products" | Dominant color extraction |
| "Analyze the product images", "Look at the main photos" | General visual feature extraction |
| "What material does it look like" | Material identification |
| "What shapes/styles are popular" | Shape or style classification |
| "Reverse the image prompt", "What prompt made this image" | Image prompt reverse-engineering |
| "Group products by visual appearance" | Visual attribute grouping & statistics |
| "Extract features from the product photos" | Structured attribute extraction |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond image-based visual analysis:

- Text-based product data queries (use appropriate data query tools)
- Listing copywriting or review analysis
- Price or sales data analysis
- Tasks that do not involve product images
