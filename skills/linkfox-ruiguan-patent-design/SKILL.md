# Ruiguan Design Patent Detection

This skill guides you on how to perform design patent infringement detection using the Ruiguan engine, helping e-commerce sellers and IP professionals identify potential design patent risks before listing products.

## Core Concepts

Design patent detection compares a product image against a global design patent database using visual similarity algorithms. The system returns patents ranked by similarity score, along with TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) litigation history, helping users assess infringement risk.

**Similarity score**: A value between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate greater visual resemblance to the patent drawing. Patents with `similarity >= 0.7` or those flagged with TRO enforcement history deserve special attention and should be reviewed carefully.

**Radar analysis**: When radar is enabled, each patent result includes a `radarResult` with a `same` flag (suspected infringement: true/false) and an `exp` field (explanation). This provides an AI-powered judgment beyond raw similarity.

**LOC classification**: The Locarno Classification (LOC) is an international system for categorizing industrial designs. You can optionally specify LOC codes to narrow the search scope, or leave it unset to let the model predict the appropriate categories automatically.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/ruiguan_detection_patent_design.py` directly to run queries.

## Local Image Upload

This tool requires a **publicly accessible image URL**. If the user provides a local image file path (e.g., `C:\Users\...\photo.png`, `/home/.../image.jpg`), you must upload it first to obtain a public URL.

Run the upload script:
```bash
python scripts/upload_image.py /path/to/local/image.png
```

The script will return a public URL (valid for 24 hours) that can be used as the image URL parameter.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic patent check for a product image (US market)**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/product.jpg",
  "queryMode": "hybrid",
  "topNumber": 50,
  "regions": "US"
}
```

**2. Multi-region check with product context**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/product.jpg",
  "queryMode": "physical",
  "topNumber": 100,
  "regions": "US,EU,CN",
  "productTitle": "Portable Wireless Charger Stand",
  "productDescription": "A foldable wireless charging stand for smartphones",
  "enableRadar": true
}
```

**3. Narrowed search using LOC classification (furniture)**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/chair.jpg",
  "queryMode": "hybrid",
  "topNumber": 80,
  "regions": "US,DE",
  "topLoc": "06",
  "patentStatus": "1"
}
```

**4. Line drawing mode for sketch-based search**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/sketch.png",
  "queryMode": "line",
  "topNumber": 50,
  "regions": "CN,JP,KR"
}
```

**5. Check both active and expired patents**
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/product.jpg",
  "queryMode": "hybrid",
  "topNumber": 100,
  "regions": "US",
  "patentStatus": "1,0"
}
```

## Display Rules

1. **High-risk patent highlighting**: When generating summaries or reports, display ALL patents with `similarity >= 0.7` or `troCase = true` in full detail. For each such patent, include: application number, patent title (Chinese), inventors, TRO enforcement history, the most-similar patent drawing, every image in the patent image list, patent abstract, patent specification, LOC info, radar analysis result, and specification text. This detailed presentation is critically important -- do NOT abbreviate or omit these fields.
2. **Disclaimer**: Always append a friendly reminder at the end: "This detection result is generated by LinkfoxAgent. It is recommended to consult a professional IP attorney for legal advice."
3. **Similarity interpretation**: Clearly explain that higher similarity scores indicate greater visual resemblance and higher infringement risk.
4. **Radar result display**: When `radarResult.same` is true, prominently flag the patent as a suspected infringement match and display the `exp` explanation.
5. **TRO warning**: Patents with `troCase = true` or `troHolder = true` should be highlighted with a warning, as they indicate the patent holder has a history of active enforcement via Temporary Restraining Orders.
6. **Image display**: Show both `patentImageUrl` (the most similar patent drawing) and the full `images` list so users can visually compare their product against all patent drawings.
7. **Error handling**: When a request fails, explain the issue and suggest corrective actions (e.g., check image URL accessibility, verify region codes).
8. **Present data faithfully**: Show query results as-is without adding subjective legal conclusions beyond the tool's own analysis.
## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Design patent risk assessment:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Check if this product infringes any design patents" | Basic patent detection |
| "Patent risk check for this image" | Image-based patent search |
| "Does this product have TRO risk" | TRO enforcement history lookup |
| "Design patent search for US and EU" | Multi-region patent detection |
| "Check appearance patent for this furniture" | Category-specific patent search |
| "Is this product design safe to sell" | Pre-listing patent clearance |
| "Find similar design patents" | Similarity-based patent discovery |
| "Patent infringement analysis" | Comprehensive patent risk report |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond design patent detection:
- Utility patent or invention patent searches
- Trademark infringement checks
- Copyright/DMCA issues
- Legal case management or litigation strategy
- Patent application or filing assistance
- Product listing optimization or pricing

**Boundary judgment**: When users mention "patent check" or "IP risk", if the concern is about product appearance/design similarity to existing patents, this skill applies. If they are asking about utility patents, trademarks, copyrights, or need actual legal counsel, this skill does not apply.


**Feedback:**

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
4. Anything you believe could be improved

Call the feedback API as specified in `references/api.md`. Do not interrupt the user's flow.
