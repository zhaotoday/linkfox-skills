# Ruiguan Utility Patent Detection

This skill guides you on how to search for similar utility (invention) patents based on a product's title, description, and target selling region. It helps cross-border e-commerce sellers identify potential patent infringement risks before listing products.

## Core Concepts

**Utility patent** (also called invention patent) protects new and useful inventions or functional improvements. Unlike design patents that protect appearance, utility patents protect how a product works, its structure, or its composition. Infringing on a utility patent can lead to product removal, lawsuits, or TRO orders.

**Similarity score**: Each returned patent includes a `similarity` field (0 to 1). A higher value means the patent is more closely related to the queried product. Patents with high similarity scores deserve careful review.

**TRO risk indicators**: Two boolean fields flag enforcement history:
- `troCase` -- whether the patent has a history of TRO enforcement actions
- `troHolder` -- whether the patent holder is known for initiating TRO cases

Patents flagged with either indicator require extra caution.

**Patent validity**: The `patentValidity` field shows whether a patent is `Active` or `Invalid`. Only active patents pose infringement risk.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| productTitle | string | Yes | Product title (max 1000 characters) |
| productDescription | string | Yes | Product description (max 1000 characters) |
| region | string | Yes | Target selling country/region code, comma-separated for multiple. Currently supports: US. Default: `US` |
| topNumber | integer | Yes | Number of patent results to return. Range: 10--200. Default: `100` |

### Parameter Guidelines

1. **productTitle**: Use the product's actual listing title or a concise descriptive title. Be specific rather than generic -- "portable USB-C fast charger 65W" is better than "charger".
2. **productDescription**: Include key features, materials, mechanisms, and technical attributes. The more detail provided, the more accurate the similarity matching.
3. **region**: Currently only `US` is supported. Always set to `US` unless the user specifies otherwise.
4. **topNumber**: Default is 100. Increase to 200 for a broader search when doing thorough patent clearance. Decrease to 10--20 for a quick preliminary scan.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/ruiguan_utility_patent_detection.py` directly to run queries.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic patent risk check for a product**

User: "Check if this silicone kitchen spatula has any patent risks in the US."

Build the request with a descriptive product title and description, region set to US, and a reasonable topNumber.

**2. Thorough patent clearance before launch**

User: "I'm about to launch a new wireless earbuds product. Do a comprehensive patent check."

Use topNumber=200 for maximum coverage. Include detailed product description covering Bluetooth version, charging case design, noise cancellation features, etc.

**3. Quick scan for TRO risk**

User: "Any TRO risks for selling LED strip lights in the US?"

After retrieving results, filter and highlight patents where `troCase` or `troHolder` is true.

**4. Investigating a specific product category**

User: "Check patent risks for a portable blender with USB charging."

Provide both the product title and a detailed description emphasizing the functional aspects (motor type, blade design, charging mechanism, capacity).

## Display Rules

1. **Present data in tables**: Show results in a clear, structured table format. Key columns to display: patent title, similarity score, patent validity, application number, publication date, TRO flags, and estimated expiration date.
2. **Sort by relevance**: Display patents sorted by similarity score in descending order (highest similarity first).
3. **Highlight high-risk patents**: Call attention to patents with similarity above 0.7, active validity status, and/or TRO flags.
4. **TRO warnings**: If any returned patents have `troCase=true` or `troHolder=true`, display a prominent warning about elevated enforcement risk.
5. **Validity filtering**: When presenting results, clearly distinguish between Active and Invalid patents. Emphasize that only Active patents require attention.
6. **Volume notice**: When results are large, show the most relevant patents (e.g., top 10--20 by similarity) and summarize the rest.
7. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason and suggest adjusting the product title or description for better results.
8. **Bilingual titles**: When available, show both the English title (`title`) and Chinese title (`titleCn`) to aid understanding.
9. **No legal advice**: Present patent data factually. Do not provide legal conclusions about infringement -- recommend consulting a patent attorney for definitive assessments.
## Important Limitations

- **Region support**: Currently only US patents are searchable
- **Result cap**: Maximum 200 patents per query
- **Input length**: Both productTitle and productDescription are limited to 1000 characters each
- **Not legal advice**: Results indicate similarity, not confirmed infringement. Professional patent review is always recommended.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent-related queries for product risk assessment:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Check patent risk for my product" | Basic patent detection |
| "Any utility/invention patent issues" | Utility patent search |
| "Is this product safe to sell (patent-wise)" | Patent clearance check |
| "TRO risk for this product" | TRO enforcement risk |
| "Similar patents for this product" | Patent similarity search |
| "Patent infringement check" | Pre-launch risk assessment |
| "Will I get sued for selling this" | Patent risk evaluation |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond utility patent detection:

- Design patent searches (appearance/ornamental design)
- Trademark or brand infringement checks
- Copyright issues
- Product compliance or certification (FCC, CE, etc.)
- General legal advice or contract review


**Feedback:**

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
