# SellerSprite Competitor Lookup

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze Amazon competitor product data, helping Amazon sellers discover competing products, benchmark performance, and extract actionable competitive intelligence.

## Core Concepts

The SellerSprite Competitor Lookup tool provides comprehensive Amazon product data across 12 marketplaces. It allows querying products by ASIN, keyword, seller name, brand, or category, and returns detailed metrics including monthly sales volume, revenue, BSR ranking, pricing, ratings, and growth trends.

**Data snapshots**: The tool supports both real-time data (last 30 days) and historical monthly snapshots. Use `nearly` (default) for current data or a `yyyyMM` format (e.g., `202501`) for historical snapshots. Historical snapshots capture all active listings for that month, enabling year-over-year and seasonal comparisons.

**Category hierarchy**: Amazon category names support multi-level paths separated by colons (`:`). For example, `Electronics:Computers & Accessories:Monitors`. Convert user-provided category descriptions into the proper colon-separated format.

## Supported Marketplaces

US (United States), UK (United Kingdom), DE (Germany), FR (France), JP (Japan), CA (Canada), IT (Italy), ES (Spain), MX (Mexico), AU (Australia), TR (Turkey), IN (India)

Default marketplace is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a marketplace.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/sellersprite_competitor_lookup.py` directly to run queries.

## Usage Examples

**1. Look up competitors by ASIN**
```json
{
  "marketplace": "US",
  "asinList": "B072MQ5BRX,B08N5WRWNW"
}
```
Use case: Analyze specific competing products by their ASINs.

**2. Search competitors by keyword**
```json
{
  "marketplace": "US",
  "keyword": "wireless earbuds",
  "matchType": 1,
  "order": {"field": "total_units", "desc": "true"},
  "size": 20
}
```
Use case: Discover top-selling products for a keyword, sorted by monthly sales.

**3. Filter by brand and category**
```json
{
  "marketplace": "US",
  "brand": "Anker",
  "nodeLabel": "Electronics:Headphones",
  "order": {"field": "total_amount", "desc": "true"}
}
```
Use case: Analyze a specific brand's product lineup within a category.

**4. Find products by seller name**
```json
{
  "marketplace": "DE",
  "sellerName": "Anker Direct",
  "order": {"field": "bsr_rank", "desc": "false"}
}
```
Use case: View all products from a particular seller sorted by BSR.

**5. Historical snapshot comparison**
```json
{
  "marketplace": "US",
  "keyword": "space heater",
  "dataSnapshotMonth": "202412",
  "order": {"field": "total_units", "desc": "true"},
  "size": 20
}
```
Use case: Analyze seasonal product performance using historical data snapshots.

**6. Show product variations**
```json
{
  "marketplace": "JP",
  "asinList": "B0XXXXXXXXX",
  "showVariation": "Y"
}
```
Use case: Examine all variation-level data for a product family.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in well-formatted tables. Include key metrics such as ASIN, title, price, monthly sales, BSR, rating, and brand. Do not provide subjective business advice unless the user asks for it.
2. **Keyword language**: When searching by keyword, always translate the keyword to the target marketplace language (e.g., English for US/UK, German for DE, Japanese for JP). Remind the user of this if they provide keywords in the wrong language.
3. **BSR clarification**: When displaying BSR data, remind users that a lower BSR value indicates stronger sales performance.
4. **Growth metrics**: When showing growth rates, clarify whether positive values mean improvement or decline (positive BSR growth count means BSR increased, which means worsened ranking).
5. **Pagination notice**: When the total result count exceeds the returned page size, inform the user of the total count and offer to fetch additional pages.
6. **Badge highlights**: When products carry badges (Best Seller, Amazon's Choice, A+ Content, Video), highlight these in the results as they are important competitive signals.
7. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the `message` field and suggest adjusting query parameters.
8. **Snapshot guidance**: When users want to do seasonal or trend analysis, proactively suggest using historical snapshots (e.g., last year's same month) for comparison.
## Important Limitations

- **Result cap**: Each page returns 10-100 records (controlled by `size`). Use pagination for larger result sets.
- **ASIN limit**: A maximum of 40 ASINs can be queried at once via `asinList`.
- **Historical snapshots**: Only existing monthly snapshots can be queried; future dates are not supported.
- **Keyword language**: Keywords should match the marketplace language for best results.
