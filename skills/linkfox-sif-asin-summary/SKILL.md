# SIF ASIN Summary

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze ASIN-level traffic source data, helping Amazon sellers understand the exposure and traffic structure of any product across multiple channels.

## Core Concepts

SIF (Search Intelligence Framework) ASIN Summary provides a comprehensive breakdown of an ASIN's traffic sources on Amazon. It reveals how a product's total exposure is distributed across organic search, Sponsored Products ads, brand ads, video ads, Amazon's Choice, Editorial Recommendations, and Top Rated recommendations. This is essential for competitive analysis and traffic strategy optimization.

**Exposure score**: A composite metric reflecting the overall visibility of a product across all keywords in a given channel. A higher score means greater exposure. The **exposure ratio** fields show what percentage of total exposure comes from each channel (values range 0~1 or 0~100 depending on the field).

**Traffic keyword count**: The total number of keywords through which a product is discovered, broken down by channel (organic search, SP ads, brand ads, video ads, etc.).

## Data Fields

> Field-name suffixes: `*Prev` = previous-period value; `*In` / `*Out` = keywords entering / exiting this period (for period-over-period comparison).

## Supported Marketplaces

13 marketplaces: US (United States), UK (United Kingdom), DE (Germany), CA (Canada), JP (Japan), FR (France), ES (Spain), IT (Italy), MX (Mexico), AU (Australia), AE (United Arab Emirates), BR (Brazil), SA (Saudi Arabia).

Default marketplace is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a marketplace. Codes outside this list will be rejected by the API pattern.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/sif_asin_summary.py` directly to run queries.

## Parameter Guide

### searchValue (required)

One or more ASIN codes separated by commas. Maximum 10 ASINs per request.

- Single ASIN: `B0XXXXXXXX`
- Multiple ASINs: `B0XXXXXXXX,B0YYYYYYYY,B0ZZZZZZZZ`

### country (optional)

Marketplace code. Defaults to `US`. See the Supported Marketplaces section for all valid codes.

### Time window (optional)

- `last7d` (boolean, default `true`): Use the latest 7 days. When `false`, the API uses `startDate`/`endDate` to define the window.
- `startDate` (string, `yyyy-MM-dd`): Start date for a custom window. Takes effect when `last7d=false`; if omitted, the system's latest ABA week is used.
- `endDate` (string, `yyyy-MM-dd`): End date paired with `startDate`.

### conditions (optional)

Comma-separated traffic-channel filters. Only returns ASIN-summary rows that have traffic from at least one of the listed channels. Valid values:

- `nf` — natural search
- `sp` — SP ads
- `sb` — SB regular
- `sbv` — video ads (SBV)
- `ad` — any ad traffic
- `acAd` — SP recommendation
- `totalPeriod.in` — newly-entered traffic keywords this period

### sortBy (optional)

Sort field. Leave empty for system default. Valid values:

`totalKeywordNum` (total keyword count), `naturalKeywordNum` (natural keyword count), `brandKeywordNum` (brand ad keyword count), `vedioKeywordNum` (video ad keyword count), `acKeywordNum` (AC keyword count), `erKeywordNum` (ER keyword count), `trKeywordNum` (TR keyword count), `sumScore` (all-keyword total exposure), `totalNfScore` (all natural exposure), `totalSpSocre` (all SP exposure; note the spelling), `totalBrandScore` (all brand ad exposure), `totalVedioScore` (all video ad exposure), `totalAcScore` (all AC exposure), `totalTrScore` (all TR exposure), `totalErScore` (all ER exposure).

### Pagination

- `pageNum`: Page number, defaults to 1
- `pageSize`: Results per page, minimum 10, maximum **10000**, defaults to **10000**

### Sorting

- `desc`: Sort in descending order when `true` (default), ascending when `false`

## Usage Examples

**1. Single ASIN traffic breakdown**
> "Show me the traffic sources for B09V3KXJPB on the US marketplace"

Query with `searchValue = "B09V3KXJPB"`, `country = "US"`.

**2. Multi-ASIN competitor comparison**
> "Compare traffic structures of B09V3KXJPB and B0BN1K7WJP on Amazon US"

Query with `searchValue = "B09V3KXJPB,B0BN1K7WJP"`, `country = "US"`.

**3. Specific marketplace query**
> "Analyze traffic sources for B07XJ8C8F5 on Amazon Japan"

Query with `searchValue = "B07XJ8C8F5"`, `country = "JP"`.

**4. Organic vs paid traffic analysis**
> "What percentage of B09V3KXJPB's exposure comes from organic search vs ads?"

Query the ASIN, then compare `naturalSearchExposureRatio` against `sponsoredProductsExposureRatio`, `brandAdExposureRatio`, and `videoAdExposureRatio`.

**5. Ad channel deep-dive**
> "How many keywords does B0BN1K7WJP advertise on through SP, brand ads, and video ads?"

Query the ASIN and present `sponsoredProductsKeywordCount`, `brandAdKeywordCount`, `topBrandAdKeywordCount`, `bottomBrandAdKeywordCount`, and `videoAdKeywordCount`.

**6. Period-over-period comparison**
> "How did this ASIN's total keywords change compared to last week?"

Query the ASIN and present `totalTrafficKeywordCount` (current), `totalTrafficKeywordCountPrev` (previous), `totalTrafficKeywordCountIn` (new this period), `totalTrafficKeywordCountOut` (exited this period). Do the same for the natural-search variant with the `naturalSearchKeywordCount*` family.

**7. Custom date range**
> "Traffic structure for B0XXX between 2026-03-08 and 2026-03-14"

```
searchValue: "B0XXX", country: "US", last7d: false, startDate: "2026-03-08", endDate: "2026-03-14"
```

**8. Filter by traffic channel and sort by SP exposure**
> "Top SP-running ASINs among my 10 products, sorted by SP exposure"

```
searchValue: "B0A,B0B,...,B0J", conditions: "sp", sortBy: "totalSpSocre", desc: true
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in well-structured tables; separate product metadata, current-period scores, keyword counts, and period-over-period comparison columns into logical groups for readability
2. **Percentage formatting**: When displaying exposure ratios, format them as percentages (e.g., 0.45 as 45.0%) for easier comprehension
3. **Traffic structure summary**: When a user queries a single ASIN, proactively summarize the traffic structure (e.g., "65% organic, 25% SP ads, 10% brand ads") to give an at-a-glance overview
4. **Period annotation**: Whenever showing `*In` / `*Out` / `*Prev` fields, label the period explicitly (e.g., "vs. previous 7 days"; or the resolved `startDate ~ endDate` range). Do not present period-over-period deltas without naming the comparison window.
5. **Competitor comparison layout**: When multiple ASINs are queried, use a side-by-side comparison table so differences are immediately visible
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the `msg` field and suggest checking the ASIN validity or marketplace selection
7. **Variant awareness**: If `isVariantProduct` is true, note that the ASIN is a variant and the user may want to also check the parent ASIN for a complete picture.
## Important Limitations

- **ASIN cap per request**: Maximum 10 ASINs can be queried in a single call
- **Page size cap**: Maximum 10000 results per page
- **Marketplace coverage**: 13 marketplaces only — IN / NL / SE / PL / TR / SG are no longer available
- **Snapshot vs window**: Default window is the latest 7 days (`last7d=true`). To query a different window, set `last7d=false` and pass `startDate`/`endDate`
- **Exposure scores are relative**: Scores are useful for cross-channel and cross-ASIN comparison, but are not absolute traffic volumes

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Traffic source and exposure analysis for Amazon ASINs:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Where does this ASIN's traffic come from" | Traffic source breakdown |
| "How much organic traffic does this product have" | Natural search exposure analysis |
| "Is this competitor running a lot of ads" | SP/brand/video ad exposure check |
| "Compare traffic structures of these ASINs" | Multi-ASIN competitor comparison |
| "Does this product have Amazon's Choice" | AC/ER/TR recommendation check |
| "What ad channels is this ASIN using" | PPC traffic source identification |
| "How many keywords does this ASIN rank for" | Traffic keyword count analysis |
| "Is this product relying on paid or organic traffic" | Organic vs paid traffic split |
| "How did keywords change vs last week" | Period-over-period comparison (In/Out/Prev) |
| "How many new organic keywords did this ASIN get" | New-in keyword count (`naturalSearchKeywordCountIn`) |
| "Pull the numbers for a specific date range" | Custom time window via `startDate`/`endDate` |
| "Rank 10 ASINs by SP exposure" | `sortBy=totalSpSocre` across a batch |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond ASIN traffic source data:
- Arbitrary multi-week historical trend curves (this tool exposes current + previous period only; use ABA data for long trends)
- Keyword-level search volume or ranking data for the ASIN (use ABA data or the ASIN-keywords tool instead)
- Sales estimation or revenue analysis
- Listing optimization or copywriting
- Advertising bid or budget recommendations

## Handling Large Responses

To avoid overflowing the agent context, persist the response to disk and extract only the fields you need:

```
python scripts/response_io.py run --script scripts/sif_asin_summary.py --out-dir <DIR> '<params>'
python scripts/response_io.py read <file> --fields "<paths>"   # or --path "<JMESPath>"
```

> Pick `--out-dir` outside any git working tree (e.g. `/tmp/...` on Unix, `%TEMP%/...` on Windows). Persisted responses may contain PII, pricing, or auth-sensitive data — do not commit them. Files are not auto-deleted; clean up when the task is done.

`run` writes the full response to a file and emits only a schema preview + file path. `read` projects specific fields, with `--limit/--offset` for slicing and `--format json|jsonl|csv|table` for output.

**When to prefer this pattern** — apply your judgment based on the response characteristics, e.g.:
- High field count per record, or fields you don't need
- Batch/paginated results (multiple items per call)
- Long-text fields (descriptions, reviews, HTML, time series)
- Output reused across later steps rather than consumed immediately

For small, single-use responses, calling the main script directly is fine.

⚠️ The preview is a truncated schema + sample, not the full data. Any field-level decision must read from the persisted file via `read`.
