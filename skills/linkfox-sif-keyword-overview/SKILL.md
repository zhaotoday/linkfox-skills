# SIF Keyword Overview

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze keyword-level competition data on Amazon, helping sellers assess market competitiveness and supply-demand dynamics for specific keywords.

## Core Concepts

The SIF Keyword Overview tool provides a comprehensive snapshot of competition metrics for a given keyword on Amazon. It returns the number of competing products across different placement types (organic, sponsored, video ads, brand ads, etc.), estimated weekly search volume, keyword popularity ranking, and the supply-demand ratio.

**Supply-demand ratio**: Calculated as `total search result product count / monthly search volume`. A lower ratio indicates less competition and greater opportunity. This is a key metric for identifying blue-ocean keywords.

**Keyword popularity ranking**: Represents where this keyword ranks among all keywords on the marketplace by monthly search volume. A smaller number means higher search popularity (rank 1 is the most popular). When a user says "ranking improved," it means the numeric value decreased; "ranking dropped" means the value increased.

## Data Fields

| Field | API Name | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Keyword | keyword | The queried keyword text |
| Keyword Popularity Rank | keywordPopularityRank | Monthly search volume rank among all keywords (lower = more popular) |
| Estimated Weekly Search Volume | estimatedWeeklySearchVolume | Estimated weekly search count on Amazon |
| Supply-Demand Ratio | supplyDemandRatio | Product count / monthly search volume (lower = less competition) |
| Total Search Result Products | totalSearchResultProductCount | Total products shown under this keyword (organic + ads + recommendations) |
| Natural Search Products | naturalSearchProductCount | Products in organic search results (excluding ads) |
| Sponsored Products (SP) Count | sponsoredProductsCount | Products running Sponsored Products ads |
| Brand Ad Products | brandAdProductCount | Products running Brand Ads |
| Video Ad Products | videoAdProductCount | Products running Video Ads |
| Total Paid Advertising Products | paidAdvertisingProductCount | All PPC ad products combined (SP + Brand + Video, etc.) |
| Amazon's Choice Products | amazonChoiceProductCount | Products with the Amazon's Choice badge |
| Top Rated Products | topRatedProductCount | Products in the Top Rated recommendation section |
| Search Recommendation Products | searchRecommendationProductCount | Products recommended by Amazon during search |
| Editorial Recommendations Products | editorialRecommendationsProductCount | Products in Editorial Recommendations section |
| Total Marketplace Keywords | totalMarketplaceKeywordCount | Total number of keywords in the marketplace |
| Data Update Time | keywordDataUpdateTime | Last update timestamp for this keyword's data |

## Supported Marketplaces

US (United States), CA (Canada), MX (Mexico), UK (United Kingdom), DE (Germany), FR (France), IT (Italy), ES (Spain), JP (Japan), IN (India), AU (Australia), BR (Brazil), NL (Netherlands), SE (Sweden), PL (Poland), TR (Turkey), AE (United Arab Emirates), SA (Saudi Arabia), SG (Singapore)

Default marketplace is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a marketplace.

**Important**: The `keyword` parameter should ideally be in the language of the target marketplace. For example, use German keywords for DE, Japanese for JP, etc. If the user provides keywords in a different language, translate them to the marketplace's local language before querying.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/sif_keyword_overview.py` directly to run queries.

## Parameter Guide

The tool accepts two parameters:

1. **keyword** (required): The search keyword to analyze. Should be translated to the target marketplace's language for best results. Maximum length: 1000 characters.
2. **country** (optional): The Amazon marketplace code. Defaults to `US`. See Supported Marketplaces above for valid codes.

### Usage Examples

**1. Basic keyword competition check**
Query: "How competitive is the keyword 'wireless charger' on Amazon US?"
```json
{"keyword": "wireless charger", "country": "US"}
```

**2. Check competition in a non-US marketplace**
Query: "How many competitors are there for 'Handyhulle' on Amazon Germany?"
```json
{"keyword": "Handyhulle", "country": "DE"}
```

**3. Supply-demand analysis for product research**
Query: "What's the supply-demand ratio for 'yoga mat' in the US?"
```json
{"keyword": "yoga mat", "country": "US"}
```

**4. Advertising competition assessment**
Query: "How many sellers are running ads on 'dog leash' in the UK?"
```json
{"keyword": "dog leash", "country": "UK"}
```

**5. Multi-marketplace comparison (multiple calls)**
Query: "Compare the competition for 'bluetooth speaker' across US, UK, and DE"
- Call 1: `{"keyword": "bluetooth speaker", "country": "US"}`
- Call 2: `{"keyword": "bluetooth speaker", "country": "UK"}`
- Call 3: `{"keyword": "Bluetooth Lautsprecher", "country": "DE"}`

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in a well-structured table format. Include all relevant metrics the user asked about.
2. **Highlight key metrics**: When showing results, emphasize the supply-demand ratio, keyword popularity rank, and total product count as these are the most actionable metrics.
3. **Ranking clarification**: When displaying keyword popularity rank, remind users that lower values mean higher search popularity.
4. **Supply-demand interpretation**: When showing the supply-demand ratio, provide context: values below 1 suggest high demand relative to supply (opportunity); values above 5 suggest a saturated market.
5. **Ad competition breakdown**: When users ask about advertising competition, break down the total paid advertising count into its components (SP, Brand, Video) for a more detailed view.
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the `msg` field and suggest adjusting query parameters (e.g., check keyword spelling, try a different marketplace).
7. **Data freshness**: Always mention the `keywordDataUpdateTime` so users know how recent the data is.
8. **No subjective advice**: Present data objectively without making business recommendations unless specifically asked.
## Important Limitations

- **Single keyword per request**: Each API call queries one keyword at a time. For multi-keyword comparisons, make separate calls.
- **Single record response**: The API typically returns one data record per keyword (`total` is usually 1).
- **Marketplace coverage**: 19 Amazon marketplaces are supported. Keywords not found in a marketplace will return empty results.
- **Keyword language**: For best accuracy, keywords should be in the local language of the target marketplace.
