# SIF Keyword Overview

This skill guides you on how to query and analyze keyword-level competition data on Amazon, helping sellers assess market competitiveness and supply-demand dynamics for specific keywords.

## Core Concepts

The SIF Keyword Overview tool provides a comprehensive snapshot of competition metrics for a given keyword on Amazon. It returns the number of competing products across different placement types (organic, sponsored, video ads, brand ads, etc.), estimated weekly search volume, keyword popularity ranking, and the supply-demand ratio.

**Supply-demand ratio**: Calculated as `total search result product count / monthly search volume`. A lower ratio indicates less competition and greater opportunity. This is a key metric for identifying blue-ocean keywords.

**Keyword popularity ranking**: Represents where this keyword ranks among all keywords on the marketplace by monthly search volume. A smaller number means higher search popularity (rank 1 is the most popular). When a user says "ranking improved," it means the numeric value decreased; "ranking dropped" means the value increased.

## Data Fields

| Field | API Name | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Keyword | keyword | The queried keyword text |
| Keyword Popularity Rank | keywordPopularityRank | Monthly search volume rank among all keywords (lower = more popular) |
| Estimated Weekly Search Volume | estimatedWeeklySearchVolume | Estimated weekly search count on Amazon |

## Supported Marketplaces

13 marketplaces: US (United States), UK (United Kingdom), DE (Germany), CA (Canada), JP (Japan), FR (France), ES (Spain), IT (Italy), MX (Mexico), AU (Australia), AE (United Arab Emirates), BR (Brazil), SA (Saudi Arabia).

Default marketplace is **US**. Use US when the user does not specify a marketplace. Codes outside this list will be rejected by the API pattern.

**Important**: The `keyword` parameter should ideally be in the language of the target marketplace. For example, use German keywords for DE, Japanese for JP, etc. If the user provides keywords in a different language, translate them to the marketplace's local language before querying.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/sif_keyword_overview.py` directly to run queries.

## Parameter Guide

1. **keyword** (required): The search keyword to analyze. Should be translated to the target marketplace's language for best results. Maximum length: 1000 characters.
2. **country** (optional): The Amazon marketplace code. Defaults to `US`. See Supported Marketplaces above for valid codes.
3. **last7d** (optional, boolean, default `true`): Use the latest 7 days. When `false`, the API uses `startDate`/`endDate`.
4. **startDate** (optional, `yyyy-MM-dd`): Start date for a custom window. Takes effect when `last7d=false`.
5. **endDate** (optional, `yyyy-MM-dd`): End date paired with `startDate`.

### Usage Examples

**1. Basic keyword competition check**
Query: "How competitive is the keyword 'wireless charger' on Amazon US?"
```json
{"keyword": "wireless charger", "country": "US"}
```

**2. Check competition in a non-US marketplace**
Query: "How many competitors are there for 'Handyhulle' on Amazon Germany?"
```json
{"keyword": "Handyhulle", "country": "DE"}
```

**3. Supply-demand analysis for product research**
Query: "What's the supply-demand ratio for 'yoga mat' in the US?"
```json
{"keyword": "yoga mat", "country": "US"}
```

**4. Advertising competition assessment**
Query: "How many sellers are running ads on 'dog leash' in the UK?"
```json
{"keyword": "dog leash", "country": "UK"}
```

**5. Multi-marketplace comparison (multiple calls)**
Query: "Compare the competition for 'bluetooth speaker' across US, UK, and DE"
- Call 1: `{"keyword": "bluetooth speaker", "country": "US"}`
- Call 2: `{"keyword": "bluetooth speaker", "country": "UK"}`
- Call 3: `{"keyword": "Bluetooth Lautsprecher", "country": "DE"}`

**6. Specific date range**
Query: "Competition for 'yoga mat' between 2026-03-08 and 2026-03-14"
```json
{"keyword": "yoga mat", "country": "US", "last7d": false, "startDate": "2026-03-08", "endDate": "2026-03-14"}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in a well-structured table format. Include all relevant metrics the user asked about.
2. **Highlight key metrics**: When showing results, emphasize the supply-demand ratio, keyword popularity rank, and total product count as these are the most actionable metrics.
3. **Ranking clarification**: When displaying keyword popularity rank, remind users that lower values mean higher search popularity.
4. **Supply-demand interpretation**: When showing the supply-demand ratio, provide context: values below 1 suggest high demand relative to supply (opportunity); values above 5 suggest a saturated market.
5. **Ad competition breakdown**: When users ask about advertising competition, break down the total paid advertising count into its components (SP, Brand, Video) for a more detailed view.
6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the `msg` field and suggest adjusting query parameters (e.g., check keyword spelling, try a different marketplace).
7. **Data freshness & period**: Always surface `keywordDataUpdateTime` (last refresh) plus `dataPeriodStartDate` ~ `dataPeriodEndDate` (the ABA week the counts describe). Do not present product counts without naming the period.
8. **No subjective advice**: Present data objectively without making business recommendations unless specifically asked.
## Important Limitations

- **Single keyword per request**: Each API call queries one keyword at a time. For multi-keyword comparisons, make separate calls.
- **Single record response**: The API typically returns one data record per keyword (`total` is usually 1).
- **Marketplace coverage**: 13 Amazon marketplaces — IN / NL / SE / PL / TR / SG are no longer supported. Keywords not found in the queried marketplace will return empty results.
- **Time window**: Defaults to the latest 7 days. Pass `last7d=false` plus `startDate`/`endDate` for a custom ABA week range.
- **Keyword language**: For best accuracy, keywords should be in the local language of the target marketplace.

## Handling Large Responses

To avoid overflowing the agent context, persist the response to disk and extract only the fields you need:

```
python scripts/response_io.py run --script scripts/sif_keyword_overview.py --out-dir <DIR> '<params>'
python scripts/response_io.py read <file> --fields "<paths>"   # or --path "<JMESPath>"
```

> Pick `--out-dir` outside any git working tree (e.g. `/tmp/...` on Unix, `%TEMP%/...` on Windows). Persisted responses may contain PII, pricing, or auth-sensitive data — do not commit them. Files are not auto-deleted; clean up when the task is done.

`run` writes the full response to a file and emits only a schema preview + file path. `read` projects specific fields, with `--limit/--offset` for slicing and `--format json|jsonl|csv|table` for output.

**When to prefer this pattern** — apply your judgment based on the response characteristics, e.g.:
- High field count per record, or fields you don't need
- Batch/paginated results (multiple items per call)
- Long-text fields (descriptions, reviews, HTML, time series)
- Output reused across later steps rather than consumed immediately

For small, single-use responses, calling the main script directly is fine.

⚠️ The preview is a truncated schema + sample, not the full data. Any field-level decision must read from the persisted file via `read`.
