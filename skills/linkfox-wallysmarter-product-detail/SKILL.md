# WallySmarter Product Detail

This skill retrieves detailed product information from Walmart via WallySmarter, including pricing history and sales volume trends.

## Core Concepts

WallySmarter Product Detail looks up a single Walmart product by its ItemId and returns comprehensive product attributes along with historical pricing and sales data. This is a product-level deep-dive tool, complementing the broader `linkfox-walmart-search` skill that operates at the search/listing level.

**Data scope**: Returns current product attributes (title, price, brand, ratings, fulfillment type, etc.) plus historical stats when `includeStats` is enabled (default).

**Non-structured output**: The tool returns mixed structured and non-structured data. It does NOT support secondary analysis via `@智能数据查询`.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| productId | integer | Yes | — | Walmart Item ID. Found in product URLs: `https://www.walmart.com/ip/<productId>` |
| includeStats | boolean | No | true | Whether to include historical price and sales data |

## Product Data Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| title | Product title |
| description | Product description |
| price | Current selling price (USD) |
| wasPrice | Strikethrough price (USD) |
| minPrice | Lowest price (USD) |
| brand | Brand name |
| rating | Average rating (0.0–5.0) |
| reviews | Total review count |
| salesEstimate | Estimated sales volume (units) |
| revenue | Estimated revenue (USD) |
| sellerName | Seller name |
| fulfillmentType | Fulfillment: MARKETPLACE or WFS |
| productPageUrl | Product page URL |
| imageUrl | Product image URL |
| departmentName | Department category name |
| departmentId | Department ID |
| listingScore | Listing quality score |
| contentScore | Content quality score |
| outOfStock | Stock status: 0=in stock, 1=out of stock |
| sponsored | Ad flag: 0=organic, 1=sponsored |
| isBranded | Brand flag: 0=no, 1=yes |
| multipleOptionsAvailable | Variant flag: 0=no, 1=yes |
| usItemId | Internal US Item ID |
| createdAt | Product creation timestamp |
| updatedAt | Last update timestamp |
| stats | Historical price and sales trend data object |

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic product lookup (with history)**
Get full details for a Walmart product including price and sales trends:
```json
{"productId": 5177343351}
```

**2. Product detail only (no history)**
Get product attributes without historical data for faster response:
```json
{"productId": 5169493923, "includeStats": false}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show product details in a structured format. Do not add subjective business recommendations unless asked.
2. **Price formatting**: Display current price alongside wasPrice when available to highlight discounts. Always show USD symbol.
3. **Trend summary**: When stats data is available, summarize price and sales trends (e.g., "Price dropped 15% over the last 30 days").
4. **Score context**: Explain listingScore and contentScore in context (higher = better quality listing).
5. **Stock and fulfillment**: Clearly flag out-of-stock items and fulfillment type (WFS vs Marketplace).
6. **Single product**: This tool queries one product at a time. If the user needs multiple products, call the tool separately for each ItemId.

## Important Limitations

- Only supports lookup by Walmart ItemId (the numeric ID in the product URL)
- Returns non-structured data — NOT compatible with `@智能数据查询` for secondary analysis
- Single ItemId per call; batch queries require multiple invocations
- Historical data availability depends on WallySmarter's tracking coverage

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** — Walmart single-product deep-dive:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "查一下这个Walmart商品的详情" | Basic product lookup |
| "这个沃尔玛产品最近价格走势如何" | Price trend analysis |
| "WallySmarter查Walmart商品5177343351" | Direct ID lookup |
| "沃尔玛这个产品销量怎么样" | Sales estimate check |
| "Walmart product detail for item XX" | English variant |
| "这个Walmart产品最近有没有降价" | Price change detection |

**Not applicable** — Needs beyond single product detail:

- Walmart product search by keyword (use `linkfox-walmart-search`)
- Bulk product comparison across multiple items simultaneously
- Walmart seller account or advertising metrics
- Real-time inventory or delivery estimates
- Category-level market analysis

**Boundary judgment**: If the user has a specific Walmart product ID or URL and wants detailed attributes, pricing history, or sales trends, this skill applies. If they want to search/browse products by keyword or category, use `linkfox-walmart-search` instead.

1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
