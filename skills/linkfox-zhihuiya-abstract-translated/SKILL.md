# Zhihuiya Patent Abstract (Translated)

This skill guides you on how to retrieve translated patent titles and abstracts from the Zhihuiya (PatSnap) patent database, supporting Chinese, English, and Japanese translations.

## Core Concepts

Zhihuiya (PatSnap) is a leading patent intelligence platform. This tool queries its database to return translated titles and abstracts for one or more patents. You can look up patents by **patent ID** or **publication (announcement) number**, and receive translations in Chinese, English, or Japanese.

**Patent identification**: Each patent can be identified by either a `patentId` (internal Zhihuiya identifier) or a `patentNumber` (public publication/announcement number such as `US20200012345A1` or `CN112345678A`). If both are provided, the patent ID takes priority.

**Family patent fallback**: When the original patent has no abstract available, you can optionally substitute the abstract from a related family patent by enabling the replacement option.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| patentId | string | At least one of patentId or patentNumber | Zhihuiya internal patent ID. Separate multiple IDs with commas. Max length 60,000 characters. |
| patentNumber | string | At least one of patentId or patentNumber | Publication (announcement) number. Separate multiple numbers with commas. Max length 60,000 characters. |
| replaceByRelated | integer | No | Whether to substitute a family patent abstract when the original is unavailable. `1` = yes, `0` = no. Default `0`. |
| lang | string | No | Target translation language. `en` = English (default), `cn` = Chinese, `jp` = Japanese. |

### Key Rules

1. **At least one identifier is required**: You must provide either `patentId` or `patentNumber` (or both). If both are supplied, `patentId` takes priority.
2. **Batch queries**: Multiple patents can be queried at once by separating values with commas.
3. **Default language is English**: When the user does not specify a language, use `en`.
4. **Family fallback**: Set `replaceByRelated` to `1` only when the user explicitly wants a substitute abstract from a family patent if the original is missing.

## Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| total | Number of patent records returned |
| data | Array of patent objects (see below) |
| data[].patentId | Zhihuiya internal patent ID |
| data[].pn | Publication (announcement) number |
| data[].title | Translated patent title |
| data[].abstractText | Translated patent abstract |
| data[].pnRelated | Publication number of the substitute family patent (only present when family replacement was used) |
| costToken | Tokens consumed by this request |

## Usage Examples

**1. Translate a single patent abstract to English by publication number**
```
Look up patent number US20200012345A1 and give me the English abstract.
```
Parameters: `patentNumber = "US20200012345A1"`, `lang = "en"`

**2. Translate multiple patents to Chinese**
```
Get the Chinese translation of abstracts for patents CN112345678A and US20200067890A1.
```
Parameters: `patentNumber = "CN112345678A,US20200067890A1"`, `lang = "cn"`

**3. Look up by patent ID with family fallback**
```
Get the Japanese abstract for patent ID 12345678. If the abstract is unavailable, use a family patent instead.
```
Parameters: `patentId = "12345678"`, `lang = "jp"`, `replaceByRelated = 1`

**4. Batch query by patent IDs**
```
Translate the titles and abstracts for these patent IDs: 111111, 222222, 333333.
```
Parameters: `patentId = "111111,222222,333333"`, `lang = "en"`

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show results in a well-structured table with patent number, title, and abstract.
2. **Indicate language**: Mention the translation language in the output header so users know which language the results are in.
3. **Family patent notice**: If `pnRelated` is present in any result, explicitly inform the user that the abstract was sourced from a family patent and show the substitute publication number.
4. **Long abstracts**: For very long abstracts, display the full text without truncation so users can review the complete content.
5. **Error handling**: When a query fails or returns no results, explain the likely cause (e.g., invalid patent number, patent not found in database) and suggest corrections.
6. **No subjective commentary**: Present the translated text as-is without adding interpretation or legal analysis of the patent content.
## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/zhihuiya_abstract_translated.py` directly to run queries.

## Important Limitations

- **Identifier required**: At least one of patent ID or publication number must be provided; the tool cannot perform keyword-based searches.
- **Translation languages**: Only Chinese (`cn`), English (`en`), and Japanese (`jp`) are supported.
- **No full-text retrieval**: This tool returns only titles and abstracts, not full patent claims or descriptions.
- **Family replacement is optional**: The substitute family patent abstract is only provided when explicitly requested via `replaceByRelated = 1`.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent abstract and title translation queries:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Translate this patent abstract" | Single patent translation |
| "What does patent XX say / what is it about" | Abstract lookup |
| "Get the Chinese/Japanese version of this patent" | Specific language translation |
| "Look up the abstract for patent number XX" | Publication number lookup |
| "Translate these patents in batch" | Batch translation |
| "The abstract is missing, try a family patent" | Family patent fallback |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond abstract translation:

- Full patent text, claims, or description retrieval
- Patent search by keyword, classification, or applicant
- Patent legal status, citation analysis, or landscape reports
- Patent valuation or infringement analysis
