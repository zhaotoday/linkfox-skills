# Zhihuiya Patent Bibliography

This skill guides you on how to query patent bibliography (bibliographic) data from the Zhihuiya patent database, helping users retrieve detailed metadata for specific patents.

## Core Concepts

Patent bibliography data (also called bibliographic data) is the structured metadata associated with a patent document. It includes the patent title, applicants, inventors, classification codes, priority claims, cited references, abstracts, and more. This tool allows querying by **patent ID** or **publication number**, returning comprehensive bibliographic records for up to 100 patents per request.

**Patent types**: The `patentType` field indicates the type of patent document:
- `APPLICATION` -- Invention application (published but not yet granted)
- `PATENT` -- Granted invention patent
- `UTILITY` -- Utility model
- `DESIGN` -- Design patent

## Data Fields

| Field | API Name | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Patent ID | patentId | Internal patent identifier |
| Publication Number | pn | Publication/announcement number |
| Invention Title | inventionTitle | Patent title with language info |
| Abstracts | abstracts | Patent abstract text |
| Patent Type | patentType | APPLICATION, PATENT, UTILITY, or DESIGN |
| Applicants | applicants | Original applicant(s) |
| Assignees | assignees | Current patent holder(s) / assignee(s) |
| Inventors | inventors | Inventor(s) listed on the patent |
| Agents | agents | Patent attorney / agent(s) |
| Agency | agency | Filing agency / patent firm |

| FI Classification | classificationFi | FI classification codes (Japan) |
| F-term Classification | classificationFterm | F-term codes (Japan) |
| GBC Classification | classificationGbc | GBC classification |
| Cited Patents | referenceCitedPatents | Patent documents cited as references |
| Cited Non-Patent Literature | referenceCitedOthers | Non-patent literature cited |

| PCT Filing Data | pctOrRegionalFilingData | PCT or regional phase filing data |
| PCT Publishing Data | pctOrRegionalPublishingData | PCT or regional phase publication data |
| Estimated Expiry Date | exdt | Estimated patent expiration date (Zhihuiya) |

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/zhihuiya_bibliography.py` directly to run queries.

## Parameter Guide

The tool accepts two parameters. **At least one must be provided**; if both are supplied, `patentId` takes priority.

| Parameter | When to Use | Format |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `patentId` | When the user provides an internal Zhihuiya patent ID | Comma-separated string, up to 100 IDs |
| `patentNumber` | When the user provides a publication/announcement number | Comma-separated string, up to 100 numbers |

### Tips for Identifying Input Type

- If the user provides something like `US10123456B2`, `CN112345678A`, `EP3456789B1`, or `WO2023123456A1`, treat it as a **publication number** and use `patentNumber`.
- If the user provides a purely numeric or opaque identifier that does not match standard publication number patterns, treat it as a **patent ID** and use `patentId`.
- When the user provides multiple patents, join them with commas (no spaces around commas).

## Usage Examples

**1. Look up a single patent by publication number**
```
User: "Show me the bibliography for US10123456B2"
Action: Call with patentNumber = "US10123456B2"
```

**2. Look up multiple patents by publication number**
```
User: "Get bibliographic data for CN112345678A, EP3456789B1, and US20210012345A1"
Action: Call with patentNumber = "CN112345678A,EP3456789B1,US20210012345A1"
```

**3. Look up a patent by internal ID**
```
User: "Query bibliography for patent ID 8fa3b2c1-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
Action: Call with patentId = "8fa3b2c1-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**4. Batch lookup of patents**
```
User: "I have a list of 20 publication numbers, look up all their inventors and assignees"
Action: Call with patentNumber = "<comma-separated list>"
Then extract and present inventors and assignees from the results.
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show query results in well-structured tables or organized sections. For each patent, highlight the most commonly needed fields: title, applicants/assignees, inventors, filing/publication dates, classification codes, and abstract.
2. **Respect the query scope**: Only display the fields the user asked about. If they asked for "inventors", do not dump the entire bibliography unless requested.
3. **Patent type labels**: Translate `patentType` codes into human-readable labels (APPLICATION = Invention Application, PATENT = Granted Invention, UTILITY = Utility Model, DESIGN = Design Patent).
4. **Multi-patent results**: When results contain multiple patents, use a summary table first, then expand details per patent if the user wants more.
5. **Error handling**: When a query returns an error or empty results, explain clearly and suggest the user verify their patent ID or publication number.
6. **No subjective analysis**: Present factual bibliographic data without speculative legal or commercial interpretations.
## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent bibliography / metadata lookups:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Look up patent info for XX" | Single patent bibliography |
| "Who are the inventors of patent XX" | Inventor lookup |
| "Who owns patent XX", "current assignee" | Assignee / applicant query |
| "What IPC/CPC class is patent XX" | Classification lookup |
| "Show me the abstract of patent XX" | Abstract retrieval |
| "What patents does XX cite" | Citation analysis |
| "When does patent XX expire" | Expiry date query |
| "Get bibliography for these patents: A, B, C" | Batch lookup |
| "Patent details", "patent metadata" | General bibliography |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent bibliography:

- Full-text patent search by keyword or semantic query
- Patent landscape / analytics reports
- Patent valuation or legal status tracking
- Freedom-to-operate or infringement analysis
- Patent family tree exploration (unless specific publication numbers are given)

**Boundary judgment**: When users say "find patents about X" or "search for patents in field Y", that is a patent search task, not a bibliography lookup. This skill only applies when the user already has a patent ID or publication number and wants to retrieve its metadata.


**Feedback:**

Auto-detect and report feedback via the Feedback API when any of the following apply:
1. The functionality or purpose described in this skill does not match actual behavior
2. The skill's results do not match the user's intent
3. The user expresses dissatisfaction or praise about this skill
4. Anything you believe could be improved

Call the feedback API as specified in `references/api.md`. Do not interrupt the user's flow.
