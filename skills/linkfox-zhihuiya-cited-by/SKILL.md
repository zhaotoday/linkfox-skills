# Zhihuiya Patent Citations Explorer

This skill guides you on how to query patent citation data from Zhihuiya (PatSnap), helping users understand the citation landscape of specific patents.

## Core Concepts

Patent citation analysis reveals how influential a patent is within its technology domain. When Patent B references Patent A in its prior art section, Patent A is said to be "cited by" Patent B. A higher citation count generally indicates greater technological significance and broader industry influence.

**Key metrics**:
- **3-year citations** (`citedBy3y`): Number of times the patent was cited within 3 years of publication. Indicates early-stage impact.
- **5-year citations** (`citedBy5y`): Number of times the patent was cited within 5 years. Indicates medium-term influence.
- **Simple family citations** (`citedBySimpleFamily`): Count of simple patent family members that cite the patent.
- **INPADOC family citations** (`citedByInpadocFamily`): Count of INPADOC patent family members that cite the patent.
- **PatSnap family citations** (`citedByPatsnapFamily`): Count of PatSnap-defined patent family members that cite the patent.

## Parameter Guide

You must provide at least one of the following identifiers. If both are supplied, patent ID takes priority.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| patentId | Zhihuiya internal patent ID. Multiple IDs separated by commas (max 100). | abc123def456 |
| patentNumber | Publication / announcement number. Multiple numbers separated by commas (max 100). | US10123456B2, CN112345678A |

**Important**: At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` is required. When the user provides a publication number (e.g., "US10123456B2"), use `patentNumber`. When they provide internal IDs, use `patentId`.

## Usage Examples

**1. Single patent citation lookup by publication number**
Query: "How many citations does patent US10123456B2 have?"
```json
{
  "patentNumber": "US10123456B2"
}
```

**2. Multiple patents citation comparison**
Query: "Compare citations for CN112345678A and CN113456789B"
```json
{
  "patentNumber": "CN112345678A,CN113456789B"
}
```

**3. Lookup by patent ID**
Query: "Get citation data for patent ID abc123def456"
```json
{
  "patentId": "abc123def456"
}
```

**4. Batch query with multiple IDs**
Query: "Citation info for these patent IDs: id001, id002, id003"
```json
{
  "patentId": "id001,id002,id003"
}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Present data in tables**: Show citation results in clear, structured tables. Include the publication number, 3-year citations, 5-year citations, and family citation counts.
2. **Highlight key metrics**: When comparing multiple patents, highlight the one with the highest citation counts.
3. **Explain family types**: If the user is unfamiliar with patent families, briefly explain the difference between Simple, INPADOC, and PatSnap family definitions.
4. **Citing patent details**: If the response includes a `citedByPatents` array with details of citing patents, present them in a sub-table or expandable list.
5. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason based on the response and suggest checking whether the patent number or ID is correct.
6. **No subjective advice**: Present factual citation data without making judgments about patent value or investment decisions.
## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/zhihuiya_cited_by.py` directly to run queries.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent citation analysis scenarios:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "How many times has this patent been cited" | Basic citation count |
| "Which patents cite this one" | Citing patent list |
| "Patent influence analysis" | Citation-based impact |
| "Compare citations between patents" | Multi-patent comparison |
| "3-year / 5-year citation count" | Time-windowed citation metrics |
| "Patent family citation data" | Family-level citation analysis |
| "Forward citations for patent X" | Synonym for cited-by lookup |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent citation data:
- Patent full-text search or semantic search
- Patent legal status or prosecution history
- Patent valuation or licensing recommendations
- Backward citations (references *made by* a patent)
