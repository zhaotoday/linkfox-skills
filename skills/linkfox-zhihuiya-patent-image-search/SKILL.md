# Zhihuiya Patent Image Search

This skill guides you on how to perform image-based patent similarity searches using the Zhihuiya patent database, helping users identify potentially similar design patents and utility model patents.

## Core Concepts

**Patent Image Search** uses visual AI models to compare a given product or design image against a global patent image database. It returns a ranked list of similar patents, enabling users to evaluate infringement risks or conduct prior-art research.

**Two patent types are supported:**

| Type | Code | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Design Patent | `D` | Protects the ornamental appearance of a product (default) |
| Utility Model Patent | `U` | Protects the functional shape/structure of a product |

**Search models** vary by patent type:

| Model ID | Patent Type | Strategy | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Design (`D`) | Intelligent Association | Recommended for design patents |
| 2 | Design (`D`) | Search This Image | Exact visual match |
| 3 | Utility Model (`U`) | Match Shape | Shape-only comparison |
| 4 | Utility Model (`U`) | Match Shape/Pattern/Color | Recommended for utility model patents |

**Scoring logic**: A higher `score` value means greater visual similarity. When presenting results, sort by score in descending order (highest similarity first) so users can prioritize the most relevant patents for review.

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/zhihuiya_patent_image_search.py` directly to run queries.

## Local Image Upload

This tool requires a **publicly accessible image URL**. If the user provides a local image file path (e.g., `C:\Users\...\photo.png`, `/home/.../image.jpg`), you must upload it first to obtain a public URL.

Run the upload script:
```bash
python scripts/upload_image.py /path/to/local/image.png
```

The script will return a public URL (valid for 24 hours) that can be used as the image URL parameter.

## Usage Examples

**1. Basic design patent search (recommended starting point)**
Search for design patents similar to a product image across all countries:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "D",
  "model": 1,
  "limit": 20
}
```

**2. Design patent search limited to specific countries**
Search only in China and the United States:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "D",
  "model": 1,
  "country": "CN,US",
  "limit": 20
}
```

**3. Utility model patent search**
Check utility model patents with shape/pattern/color matching:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "U",
  "model": 4,
  "country": "CN",
  "limit": 20
}
```

**4. Search with Locarno classification filter**
Narrow results to a specific product category (e.g., LOC 07-01 for tableware):
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "D",
  "model": 1,
  "loc": "07-01",
  "preFilter": 1,
  "limit": 20
}
```

**5. Search only active patents within a date range**
Find active design patents filed after 2020:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "D",
  "model": 1,
  "simpleLegalStatus": "1",
  "applyStartTime": "20200101",
  "limit": 30
}
```

**6. Search by specific assignee**
Find patents held by a particular company:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "D",
  "model": 1,
  "assignees": "Apple Inc.",
  "limit": 20
}
```

**7. Get results with Chinese-translated titles**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg",
  "patentType": "D",
  "model": 1,
  "lang": "cn",
  "limit": 20
}
```

## Display Rules

1. **Sort by score**: Always sort results by `score` in descending order (highest similarity first) to help users quickly identify the most relevant infringement risks.

2. **Show complete details**: When summarizing results or generating reports, include ALL of the following for each patent -- do NOT omit or abbreviate:
   - Application number (`apno`)
   - Patent title in Chinese (use `lang: cn` or provide translation)
   - Inventor (`inventor`)
   - Patent drawing (the matched `url` image)
   - **Every** patent image in the image list
   - Patent abstract
   - Patent description
   - LOC classification information (`loc`)
   - Radar result (`radarResult`) if available
   - Patent specification

3. **Legal disclaimer**: Always append a friendly reminder at the end of results:
   > This search result was generated by LinkfoxAgent. It is recommended to consult a professional patent attorney for legal advice.

4. **Score explanation**: Remind users that the score represents visual similarity -- a higher score indicates a closer match, but does not constitute a legal determination of infringement.

5. **Pagination guidance**: When the total count exceeds the returned results, inform users about the total number of matching patents and guide them to use `offset` and `limit` for additional pages.

6. **Error handling**: When a query fails, explain the reason and suggest adjustments (e.g., verify the image URL is publicly accessible, check country codes, adjust date formats).
## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Image-based patent similarity searches:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Check if my product design infringes any patents" | Design patent infringement check |
| "Search for similar design patents" | Design patent similarity search |
| "Find patents that look like this image" | Visual patent lookup |
| "Are there any patents similar to my product appearance" | Appearance risk assessment |
| "Utility model patent search by image" | Utility model search |
| "Check patent risks for this product in China and US" | Multi-country patent check |
| "Find active design patents in this category" | Filtered patent search |
| "Who holds patents similar to this design" | Competitor patent discovery |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent image search:
- Text-based patent search (keyword/abstract/claim search)
- Patent legal status monitoring or annuity management
- Patent valuation or licensing negotiation
- Freedom-to-operate (FTO) legal opinions
- Patent family or citation analysis

## Handling Large Responses

To avoid overflowing the agent context, persist the response to disk and extract only the fields you need:

```
python scripts/response_io.py run --script scripts/upload_image.py --out-dir <DIR> '<params>'
python scripts/response_io.py read <file> --fields "<paths>"   # or --path "<JMESPath>"
```

> Pick `--out-dir` outside any git working tree (e.g. `/tmp/...` on Unix, `%TEMP%/...` on Windows). Persisted responses may contain PII, pricing, or auth-sensitive data — do not commit them. Files are not auto-deleted; clean up when the task is done.

> This skill exposes multiple entry scripts: `upload_image.py`, `zhihuiya_patent_image_search.py`. Pass `--script scripts/<name>.py` to choose the one you need.

`run` writes the full response to a file and emits only a schema preview + file path. `read` projects specific fields, with `--limit/--offset` for slicing and `--format json|jsonl|csv|table` for output.

**When to prefer this pattern** — apply your judgment based on the response characteristics, e.g.:
- High field count per record, or fields you don't need
- Batch/paginated results (multiple items per call)
- Long-text fields (descriptions, reviews, HTML, time series)
- Output reused across later steps rather than consumed immediately

For small, single-use responses, calling the main script directly is fine.

⚠️ The preview is a truncated schema + sample, not the full data. Any field-level decision must read from the persisted file via `read`.
