# Zhihuiya Patent PDF Downloader

This skill guides you on how to retrieve patent PDF full-text download links from the Zhihuiya patent database, supporting lookup by patent ID or publication number.

## Core Concepts

The Zhihuiya Patent PDF service provides direct download links to the full-text PDF documents of patents worldwide. You can query by **patent ID** or **publication number** (also called public announcement number), and retrieve up to **100 patents** in a single request.

**Lookup priority**: When both `patentId` and `patentNumber` are supplied, the service uses `patentId` first. This is important to remember when both identifiers are available.

**Family substitution**: If a patent's own PDF is unavailable, the service can optionally return the PDF of a related family patent instead.

## Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| patentId | string | Conditionally | Patent ID(s). At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided. Separate multiple values with commas. Max 100 entries. |
| patentNumber | string | Conditionally | Publication/announcement number(s). At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided. Separate multiple values with commas. Max 100 entries. |
| replaceByRelated | string | No | Whether to substitute with a family patent PDF when the original is unavailable. `1` = yes, `0` = no. Defaults to no substitution. |

### How to Choose the Right Identifier

- **Patent ID** (`patentId`): An internal numeric identifier within the Zhihuiya system. Use this when the user provides Zhihuiya-specific IDs.
- **Publication Number** (`patentNumber`): The public-facing patent number (e.g., `US20230012345A1`, `CN115000000A`). Use this when the user provides standard patent numbers.

## Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| total | Number of records returned |
| data | Array of patent objects, each containing download information |
| data[].patentId | The patent ID |
| data[].pn | The publication/announcement number |
| data[].pdfPath | The PDF full-text download URL |
| data[].pnRelated | Publication number of the substitute family patent (only present when family substitution is used) |
| costToken | Tokens consumed by the request |

## API Usage

This tool calls the LinkFox tool gateway API. See `references/api.md` for calling conventions, request parameters, and response structure. You can also execute `scripts/zhihuiya_pdf_data.py` directly to run queries.

## Usage Examples

**1. Single Patent by Publication Number**
```
Retrieve the PDF for patent publication number US20230012345A1.
```
Parameters: `{"patentNumber": "US20230012345A1"}`

**2. Multiple Patents by Publication Number**
```
Download PDFs for CN115000000A, CN115000001A, and CN115000002A.
```
Parameters: `{"patentNumber": "CN115000000A,CN115000001A,CN115000002A"}`

**3. Single Patent by Patent ID**
```
Get the full-text PDF for patent ID 12345678.
```
Parameters: `{"patentId": "12345678"}`

**4. With Family Substitution Enabled**
```
Download the PDF for EP4000000A1. If it is unavailable, use a family patent PDF instead.
```
Parameters: `{"patentNumber": "EP4000000A1", "replaceByRelated": "1"}`

**5. Batch Download by Patent IDs**
```
Retrieve PDFs for patent IDs 11111111, 22222222, 33333333.
```
Parameters: `{"patentId": "11111111,22222222,33333333"}`

## Display Rules

1. **Present download links clearly**: For each patent, show the publication number and its PDF download link in a clean table or list format.
2. **Highlight substitutions**: If a PDF was provided via family patent substitution, explicitly note this and show the `pnRelated` value so the user knows which family patent was used.
3. **Batch results**: When multiple patents are returned, present them in a table with columns: Publication Number, Patent ID, PDF Link, and Substitution Note (if applicable).
4. **Error handling**: When a query fails or returns no results, explain the reason and suggest the user verify the patent ID or publication number. If `replaceByRelated` was not enabled, suggest enabling it as an alternative.
5. **No PDF available**: If a patent entry is returned without a `pdfPath`, inform the user that the PDF is not available and suggest enabling family substitution.
## Important Limitations

- **Batch limit**: A maximum of 100 patents per request.
- **Identifier requirement**: At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided; the request will fail if both are empty.
- **Priority rule**: When both identifiers are provided, `patentId` takes precedence over `patentNumber`.
- **PDF availability**: Not all patents have PDFs available. Use the `replaceByRelated` option to fall back to family patents.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent PDF document retrieval tasks:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Download the PDF for patent XX" | Single patent PDF retrieval |
| "Get full-text documents for these patents" | Batch patent PDF download |
| "I need the PDF for publication number XX" | Lookup by publication number |
| "Can I get the patent document even if it's not directly available" | Family substitution scenario |
| "Batch export patent PDFs" | Multi-patent batch download |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent PDF retrieval:
- Patent search or discovery (finding patents by keyword, assignee, etc.)
- Patent citation or legal status analysis
- Patent claim interpretation or translation
- Patent portfolio analytics or landscape mapping
